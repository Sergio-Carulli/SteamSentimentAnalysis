10,"This will be more of a ''my experience with this game'' type of review, because saying things like ''great gameplay'' will not suit something I've experienced with Counter-Strike. Here you go:  I remember back in 2002 I was at a friend's house and he was playing a game. I didn't know the name of the game nor I had internet to find it. A few weeks passed by and another friend came over. He didn't have a computer, so he brought a disc with a game in it. He told me that it was one of the best games and from that very moment I knew that it is going to be the game I saw at the other friend's house. When I saw the Counter-Strike logo I was filled with gamegasm (?) and I was so happy. I was playing it hardcore. Made friends, clans, was involved in communities and even made two myself. Counter-Strike is my first game which I played competitively and it was a such an experience. Playing public servers with mods were very fun, but playing it competitively made it very intense and stressful. In a pleasant way, ofcourse. Looking at the current e-sport scene it might not seem like much but back then it was different.  Shooters these days try to be different, advanced in a way. Sometimes the most simple games like Counter-Strike are the ones that live to this day. Also, there are plenty of mods to keep your attention to this game. The gameplay is very simple - defend as a Counter-Terrorist, attack as a Terrorist to plant the bomb or save the hostages as a CT. I am sure most of you already know this and I doubt there are gamers that haven't heard or know the gameplay of Counter-Strike, so I am sharing here more of my experience.  I wish I could find my CS Anthology account which I've lost since 2008. So, I decided I am going to buy this game again and here you go - more than a thousand hours played. I still play it from time to time to this day and it brings back many great memories and I sometimes even stumble upon people I've played with years ago. I think Counter-Strike changed gaming in a major way and we wouldn't have many games like we have today, if this game wouldn't exist.   I am sure many of people already have played games like CS:GO but never the roots. I doubt any of you will play it for more than an hour, because it's much more simple and it differs a lot in my opinion from CS:GO and modern games. It's harder though.",1,1

Its a great game and all, you just cant stop playing it, you can just sit and play with your friends for days with out stoping. The huge weaoponary option you can choose and the smooth and sound of the game, its just f*cking addicting. With this games I've met so many different people and unique friends. This game is literally G(OLD). To all the young players who are looking for a good cheep and fun game to play with their friends, I highlly recommend on this. I've got (with steam record) 2,484hrs record in counter strike IN TOTTAL,,, and who knows how many more hrs in a non official steam version of this game.... Great Game. GG WP.

10,"CS is one of the greatest and undermined games in history. It is, in my opinion, the best  game to ever have a crosshair. It is not a contact sport, so for the girly girls, it is an activity to indulge in.  It starts off with a team trying to kill another team.   I started playing cs when I noticed jacking off isn't the only activity to do on a computer. I started inviting a lot of friends out and getting drinks, as well as a boom box, to spend a nice summer day in the living room playing this wonderful game. I wanted to play every chance that i could. On my road of cs adventures, I encountered a couple of problems; those being that nobody was as fervent as I was about playing, and that when we did play, nobody was good enough, so it wasn't a lot of fun.  Then I discovered that I could sign up for a class with dboorn. I was overly excited, and signed up, but with skepticism at how the class was going to be. Sure enough, I was proven wrong. We started off by practicing a little bit. Then we split off into teams and started playing almost everyday of class. I made some friends, and played with people who had built up their skill gradually over the period of the course.  When I play counterstrike, the whole world disappears. Only I, the mouse, and my teammates remain. We are united in a common goal. We strive collectively towards an end we all desire. Each player has a spot to hold. They stand ready and waiting, eager for their chance to aid the team in what they hope will be a forthcoming victory. Thus, CS celebrates the unity of man, the indomitable spirit in all of us that pushes us and drives us towards excellence. When I play CS, I play until my veins pump battery acid, and then I play some more.  CS is unique among the games because it teaches all of us that no matter where we are in life, there is a role for us to play, and we can help our fellow man by fulfilling that role, and thereby our destiny. What destiny might you ask? I spoke before of unity. And it is that unity that brings us all together like one big loving family. That is the nature of counter-strike; the many working as one. One machine made of well oiled cogs and wheels, moving in unison, happy to play their part in the production of something greater than themselves. Not that these small metal objects are actually animate, I'm of course speaking only metaphorically.  Over the course of the years, I have increased in skill, but I have learned a greater lesson than how to be a better cs player. I have learned how to cooperate with a team to accomplish a goal that we all share. Even if that team is less than ideal. I have realized that cs is about more than just one's athletic ability. Instead, there is a deeper meaning behind the colt, the AK, the AWP, the deagle, the sands under my feet (in d2 or inferno). And more importantly, the teammates at my side. I love them. It is the human element of cs that gives cs its greatness.  In conclusion, I love cs. I love to win. I love pushing myself to my physical limits. It's that feeling that first drove me to the computer. For every second that I am not playing cs, there is only an unquenchable thirst to play. A thirst that grows as every minute passes by when I am outside, sitting at the television, or playing sports. I had an extraordinary time playing this game, and I will return to look at the future students of this game to see that bright eager look on their faces to remind me of how I used to feel. This review may be over, this game may be dead, but I will never stop playing couner-strike (1.6).",1,1

10,"  Update to my review with some shameless advertising 05/10/2016:   Hey readers. I am now hosting a server on CS 1.6 where you can play and enjoy the fun experiences I did back in the day.   Map rotations vary from Vehicle, Aim, Surf, Knife, Defusal, and Hostage maps! IP Address: 173.199.73.78:27025     Review 21/10/2014:   I've played this game since I was around 6 years old back in 2002 and it still makes me laugh and have fun whenever I launch it to this very day. Over 12 years of endless entertainment. No other game on this planet has given me more entertainment and enjoyment than Counter-Strike 1.6 has and I doubt no game ever will.  Reason i've only got 38 hours here is because I no longer use the account I originally played cs 1.6 on.   func_vehicle is what makes this Counter Strike game the best out of all the others in the franchise.  Find a server that has car maps or maps with func_vehicle entities and you will have endless fun running over teammates and enemies in all kinds of hilarious and goofy vehicles not giving a care in the world.  You can drive a fork with a meatball on the end of it. Do i need to say more?  Mods on this game are amazing too. There is a mod where you can catch pokemon, level them up, train them and use their skills. Call of Duty mod that is suprisingly better than cod its self, Warcraft mods, zombie mods, basebuilder and so on...  There is even a map for the jailbreak gamemode that has driveable snowmobiles.   1337/10  Leet crew 5 lyf  Kicks csgo's ♥♥♥ by a mile. I forgot how good wallbanging is in this game.  P.S - CS 1.6 is the only Counter Strike game where you can headshot with a knife or buy Riot Shields. Enjoy!  Oh yeah, you don't have to pay to use sprays in this game either.",1,1

With the time i learn how to modding on CS 1.6 servers,plugins and more stuffs about PC. After this i learn how to aim on the enemy head, how to fire inside the walls, how to hear someone with his steps and HOW TO FIGHT!!! I have played many FPS(First Person Shooter) Games that they called me hacker of my fast killing. I had so fyckin good and bad moments on that game that i will not forget never.

10," After 14 years of existence, this legendary game is still in the Steam top 10 most played multiplayers in the world .   While earning tons of money based on Counter-Strike sales, Valve shows its appreciation to the players that bought the game by still not maintaining it and treating it like it doesn't even exist. Even more, starting with February 2013, Valve has released a couple of minor updates for Counter-Strike which intentionally created problems for the game(suddenly stopping afterwards) so that the players would be forced to migrate to and buy CS:GO(which currently has and most probably will keep having major problems like fps drops and hit misdetection - problem present on all Source engine based multiplayers since 2004).  Congratulations, Valve .    Counting the players that migrated to or play the non-Steam version of Counter-Strike, the game still easily classifies itself even today in the top 5 most played multiplayers in the world .",1,0

10,"'Lock and Load.' 'Go go go!' 'Fire in the hole!' 'The bomb has been planted.' 'Counter-terrorists/terrorists Win.'  It is uncountable just how many times have these few sentences echoed in cybercafés across the world. For many, days were spent in front of the computer screen, manipulating the WASD keys with left hand and whirling the mouse with the right one. People yell and frown, they cheer and jeer as they team up their cyber-persona and pit them against another team. It doesn’t matter who won, who lost, who managed to kill to most of their opponents and who died the most, as everything will be scrambled up and reset when a new match begins. What is important is that, for those who are a part of the team, this computer game is their reality. These personas within the computer screen are their true identities. This is counter-strike.   Originally a modification (mod in short) made for Valve’s critically acclaimed Half-Life, Counter-Strike has gained much prominence since its initial launch. It is one of the first and definitely one of the most critically acclaimed multi-player computer games of all times. It is also the game used for many professional electronic sports competitions, such as ESEA League. Of course, this does not put Counter-Strike as a “professional only” game, as it has been enjoyed by many since its launch.  Getting started with Counter-strike is simple. You start off in one of the two teams: Counter-Terrorists or Terrorists. Before the round begins, you will have to purchase your own gun from the market, namely the famous AK47, M4A1, Desert Eagle, MP5, AWP and many more. Do not ask me why the counter-terrorists (namely the police) have to buy their own gun, and that they will have to go out with their lousy default colt pistols. Perhaps the government had some budget cuts and the SWATs have to buy their own guns. No one knows, but at least this will balance up the game. Also, you can equipment such as Highly-Explosive grenades, Flash-bangs (not recommend for beginners), smoke grenades, helmets and kevlars. You can also grab a defuse kit if you are playing on the side of the counter-terrorist, but normally we will steal that from dead teammates. Oh and you will be given a knife for free. Don’t worry about it, as most likely you use it to run instead of anything else.  The gameplay is fairly straightforward as well. There are quite a few number of game mods. The most frequently played ones are the Bomb Defusal maps, such as the all-time famous de_dust, the Hostage Rescue maps such as cs_assault, the VIP Escorting maps and the Kill Them All maps, such as the custom fy_iceworld and awp_map. Like all multi-player First Person Shooters, you will need good coordination and communication with your teammates if you want to win. Don’t worry about it though, because if you are new, just stick around and listen to what others have got to say. Just remember, you are not John Rambo, you only have 100 HP, and a stray bullet from a sniper rifle (AWP) will deal more damage than that.  As time press on, the mechanism of Counter-Strike became outdate. Of course, the legacy of Counter-Strike continues through its successors such as Counter-Strike: Condition Zero, Counter-Strike: Source, Counter-Strike Online (Asia only) and, the newest of all, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. Throughout the years, Counter-Strike has evolved to become what it is today while its legend remains. Together with Half-Life and (maybe) Team Fortress Classic, Counter-Strike has not only helped Valve to thrive as a gaming company, but also defined what First Person Shooter should be.",1,0

10,"First starting off as a cute, little mod based on the GoldSrc engine, a heavily modified Quake engine, Counter-Strike's legacy continues to strife for a decade and a half over. Initially developed and released on top of a Half-Life modification, with the inspiration from the developer's strong theme and intriguement for military warfare and terrorism, the mod's success was immediately a marvel to behold; selling over 25 million units as a whole in the Counter-Strike franchise.  The maps and various scenarios set around the globe, players assume the roles of soldiers on two teams, counter-terrorists and terrorists. Both with a task, depending differently on the mission. Bomb scenarios, the terrorist team must plant a bomb, in a secured bomb location, while the counter-terrorists must fight back and ultimately defuse the bomb, if it may have been planted. Hostage scenarios is where the counter-terrorists must rescue a group of hostages being held by the terrorists. With both these modes, it has become a traditional campaign over time in different sequels.  The player, depending on what team they have been assigned to, can change their class into eight different character models, as well as buying weaponry and equipment, such as armour and grenades to help against the opposing team. As the round is about to begin, you're left in ''Freeze time'' that allows you to buy things with the money you earned by killing opponents the rounds before. This of course, gives players the time needed to choose wisely on what many strategies they will execute and whether it will be successful compared to your opponents.   This game is also highly customizable on the player's end.The game gives the options allowing for the user to either install or create their own custom skins, spray graphics, sprites, sound effects and HUDS that can be used in-game. I forgot to mention that modding is possibly one the biggest things that makes Counter-Strike such a versatile game to begin with.  I don't have much to complain about this game, other than it's become one of the biggest targets of hacking and cheaters, since its release. Aimbots, that auto-target other players while the player should naturally aim and shoot is just on of the many cheatings that players have executed. Wallhacks, that allows the player to see through walls through work by displaying objects that have translucent textures and can easily see targets through them, while the opposing team has no idea from their own perspective. To me, the cheating in this game is now more to do with experimenting than it is to do with cheating overall.   There's a different meaning when it comes to something that is outdated and old-school. Old-school is for nostalgic value, something that will guarantee to put a smile back on your face from all these past memories you've experienced and this is what the first title of Counter-Strike engulfs. Outdated, being something you don't particularly want to go back to, while there is the famous remake, Counter-Strike: Source, that runs on the more powerful and overly-recycled Source engine, allowing for better graphic and communication capabilities. Nevertheless, if you're looking for original flare that is burning in the Counter-Strike series, this game is definitely for you.  And to think, all of this success for the Counter-Strike series began as small little mod. Proof on how something so little, can create something so big. Recommended.",1,1
10,This game is unlike the other counter strike games. This game requires a different type of skill. You have to become used to the recoil each weapon has. You also have to become familiar with the different advantage points of each map. I personally think this is the best counter-strike game.,1,1

10,The best game ever :D !,1,1
10,In this game you can play many many modes and its the most positive thing. Its not only about shooting or about playing tactic games. You can just 'chillout' on some kinds of servers and thats what I always loved in CS 1.6.,1,1

10,"In the days of my youth I was told what it means to be the game And now I've reached that age I try to do all those things without a shame No matter how I try I find my way to the same old jam  Good times, bad times You know there was a game When a woman left home for a brown-eyed man But I still play and not seem to care  Sixteen, I fell in love with a game as sweet as could be It only took a couple of years till I was rid of it I swore that I won't play again and I did not come back But when that CS:GO came out I knew it will be sad  Good times, bad imes You know graphs' not at 1st place When a 'smurf' plays against silver ranked men Bring me back to those happy days  Hitbox was good and people were kind now it's not the same Those amazing rounds deep on my mind and all the pros into hall of fame If you talk about cybersport so that game was of that type Now just money flows like a river and everyone's getting hyped  Good times, bad times You know what do I mean When people were saying - go 1 on 1? And you knew it will be fun   9.3    Nearly the best online game in the world.  Don't start playing GO if you haven't played that... who am I talking to, you never played you never will.",1,1

10,Best FPS game of all time. It's a shame only a few people still play it. Great for older Counter Strike players and newer ones to experience what older players had with this game :) This is where Counter-Strike is love Counter-Strike is life really have a meaning.  After several thousand hours in the game I still love and cherish it. A must have for any FPS player out there.,1,1

10,"Simply THE best shooter that you can play, to forget the anger that built up inside of you after playing too much CS:GO. It truely is a relief to play another shooter than CS:GO, without messing with your aim, movement, etc.  Just set everything up the way it is in CS:GO (sensitivity, key-binds, etc.) and escape from the austerity pressure to perform well in CS:GO. And RELAX theres nothing you can do wrong here. Even when there's a cheater, just don't give a f. I mean, there isn't even a stats-record. Like there's only a serversided stats-tracking if at all. So without specifically searching for your stats on a specific server that has some kind of player-stats on it, nobody will ever know how bad you are/were :)",1,1

10,"Counter Strike is the best shooting game, i've ever played. The 'real cs', where you plant bombs etc. is not 10/10 gaming, but look at all those great mods! The greatest thing in cs is playing mod servers, and you do not need to download them from your web, you just simply double click that server, and that's it! At first I recommend to play normal cs, if it gets boring try other servers. Oh and original maps aren't that great, except de_dust2. You must try cs even if you think it has low graphics. Gameplay is much more important than graphics, remember that!",1,1

Because this game's focus isn't on graphics. It's for having fun with your friends, or, even aim for world turnaments.  All proffesional teams, such as fnatic, navi, sk, still play Counter-Strike, doesn't matter if it is 1.6, Source or Global Offensive.   Highly recommend this game.",1,0

10,"One of the most favourite game of my childhood I have spent so much time playing it and I loved it.  From a little cute Half-Life mod to this... When Counter-Strike was first released it gained it's popularity immediately and become number 1 online action game, one of the most successful competitive games ever created which was easy to learn but hard to master, now Counter-Strike is dead or at least for someone because it's pro scene died in 2012, yes the pro scene is dead but the game itself is still alive, after so many years people still play and love this game, even it's pro scene lasted for unreal time, imagine it started in 2000 year and lasted for 12 years how cannot this be legendary, it's when graphics doesn't matter only gameplay.  I strongly recommend to play this game at least once if you have ever played it and enjoyed, it might not be as fun as before but I still recommend, if you like original games or havent played CS at all and started from CS:S, CS:GO doesn't matter... You should really give it a try.",1,1

If you havent played this and you play other CS games then you know nothing about this game...

10,"Quake was the first game I was ever really addicted to and focused a big portion of my time on for months or years at a time. Counter-Strike was the second - and easily more addicting. There's a reason that I still compare every multi-player shooter experience back to original Counter-Strike, to this day. There's a reason I still compare every server community to this (Counter-Strike servers each had their own community and personality and people truly got to know each other back in the day, compared to these days, where a server is just something you're automatically dumped into and feels like every other server).  Despite many iterations, nothing quite plays like the original. It's not hard to see why there are still 10,000 to 60,000 people playing this  at any one time on any day , fifteen years after launch and why it is always in the top ten games currently being played on all of Steam.  This is where it all started. Without this, there's an entire genre of shooter and multi-player that just vanishes. The original days of Counter-Strike remain the most enjoyable gaming experiences of my entire life. It's unlikely that will ever be trumped.",1,0

10,"Counter-Strike was the game that changed everything for me in FPS games, coming from older games like the FPS Game Blood back in (1997) when I was only 10 years old and Half-Life, Counter-Strike changed everything for me it was litterally the best thing ever.  The quality of the game was never about the visuals for me but about the game play and performance and Counter-Strike litterally had it all in my opinion.  Even today after so many years, I occasionally come back and play Counter-Strike just because it is one of the greatest Counter-Strike versions flat out, anyone disputing this are most likely people that started playing either Counter-Strike: Source or Counter-Strike: Global Offensive first then tried Counter-Strike but if you played it in the right order there is no disputing this, because this game might frighten most the new generation that has expectations to visual graphics having to have a certain standard before they will even touch it.  Counter-Strike is not about the visuals, that is just a bonus, if you want visuals then you probably playing the wrong game, Counter-Strike was never Battlefield nor CoD which probably to many looks visually stunning.  If you want quality in a game then Counter-Strike is one of the best games to play and get, hence why I am recommending this game.",1,1

Graphics - nVidia Geforce 4 MX440  Memory - 256 MB with uknown specs anymore. Up to 80 GB hard disk storage that's all I got.

I recommend this game to all, but firstly buy Counter Strike: Conditon Zero and complete game on hardest difficul two times. Then play Counter Strike.

The grapichs are still awsome to me, I play a lot of Black Ops 3 on ps4, this is way better than that for me.

(I still remember to this day, the character's legs weren't moving, it was on cs_siege) This was back in late 1999 or early 2000, now its allmost 2017 and I am still playing ! That is 17 years. This game has stood the test of time. Modern games are spurring like mushrooms with advanced graphics and whatnot, but none of them can give you the experience that this game can give you. I can sincerely say that there are a total of 2 maybe 3 games in all gaming history that can match this game's gaming experience. All in all I recommend this game to any new players who may come across it, who are looking for an amazing online multiplayer experience, and also a big shoutout for the old-school player as myself, don't stop playing this gem ! I sincerelly fear that it will take a very long time until a masterpiece of a game like this will appear, maybe even never. But who knows ? Untill then start cs 1.6 gl and hf ! :)",1,1

VALVE shame on you) - You have character selection (removed in cs:go) - you have no ranking &amp; market feature (added in cs:go, everyone plays cs:go because they think they end up as a rich-♥♥♥♥♥, also on every server there is trade spam in chat and even you get friendrequest spam from traders, also community is not looking at your skill anymore, but at your rank and not every server + singleplayer against bots has rank enabled.)  - You have no CoD clone like CS:GO  Unlike CS:GO, everyone plays this for fun, not for useless skins, money, rank etc.. also, here you cant waste 600$ for a skin. You can get even new models (which does not only change your weapon texture, but the model) from gamebanana for FREE! You can make your M4 look like the G36C etc.  10/10 my fav childhood game",1,1

(Awesome because many servers have players that have Brazilians, Romanians, and many other South American/Eurpoean players) -Love nostalgia? -Love to have fun? -Love getting an extra game with bots in it for free?  -Love randomly dying from wallbangs?  Great, you've come to the right game. Seriously though, despite the somewhat smaller North American community (Which is still big for the old game it is) it's probably one of the greatest games i've ever come to play, and i've only had it for about a year, and i'm gonna add hundreds of thousands of hours playing this. I don't even have actual friends that play with me yet I can still have fun with this game. From the countless recoil patterns to remember from all the guns, to the extremely friendly community (for the most part) and playing all these classic maps. Yes, of course there's hackers, you'll see a few of them, but they don't ruin the game. Either the server's admin can just ban them or you can just go to a different server, it's not gamebreaking or anything. And besides, if you get this you also get Counter-Strike: Condition Zero, which has bots. Hell, you can even download Zbots for 1.6, and it waypoints for you! Definitely get this game. This game stands the test of time.  10/10 Would throw brick-looking grenades at terrorists again.",1,1
10," Counter-Strike:  I started playing cs when I noticed jacking off isn't the only activity to do on a computer.  Sometimes the most simple games like Counter-Strike are the ones that live to this day. The gameplay is very simple - defend as a Counter-Terrorist, attack as a Terrorist to plant the bomb or save the hostages as a CT.  CS is one of the greatest and undermined games in history. It is, in my opinion, the best game to ever have a crosshair. ",1,1
10,"If you can't get Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, this is great replacement for it. It's not as popular, but it still has a big amount of players. Some servers may be in languages you can't understand, but the game is still very fun and requires a great amount of skill. One of the best first person shooters, that still holds to this day from 1999. Although the game's graphics...aren't really the best. Even then, you can get skins, map textures, etc. to spice the graphics up a little bit. Though to me, graphics don't really matter. Highly recommend this game. 9.5/10",1,1

10,"Counter-Strike is a first-person shooter video game developed by Valve Corporation. It was initially developed and released as a Half-Life modification by Minh 'Gooseman' Le and Jess 'Cliffe' Cliffe in 1999, before Le and Cliffe were hired and the game's intellectual property acquired. Counter-Strike was first released by Valve on the Microsoft Windows platform in 2000. The game later spawned a franchise, and is the first installment in the Counter-Strike series. Several remakes and Ports of Counter-Strike have been released on the Xbox console, as well as OS X and Linux.   Set in various locations around the globe, players assume the roles of members of combating teams that include counter-terrorists and terrorists. During each round of gameplay, the two teams are tasked with defeating the other by the means of either achieving the map's objectives, or else killing all of the enemy combatants. Each player may customize their arsenal of weapons and accessories at the beginning of every match, with currency being earned after the end of each round.",1,1

10,"Yeah... the old Counter-Strike.... Everybody know, what CS is.. Counter-Strike - My rating - 9/10   Why or Why not to play this old classic ?  Positive:  It´s a legendary game, and if u playing games like CS:GO etc. u will like it, cause it will be legendary in your library. Almost everybody played CS 1.6 'from start his cs:go career' Counter-Strike 1.6 is latest and best version on the game, and if u purchase CS, u can play it, if u will download it, there´s is some chance, that u cant play it (Win 8 etc).  Most of legens/pro´s in CS:GO played CS 1.6, it´s like beginning, and it could be your beginning!   Negative: No more good tournaments on CS 1.6 (On CS:GO are tournaments like EMS, Dreamhack etc.) Graphic+Gameplay - Graphic sucks... but its still better then WarZ:P Gameplay.... yeah, crouching sucks, aiming sucks... u know... bad gameplay, if u see CS:GO, when is all so smooth, u will hate CS 1.6... but if u play CS 1.6 before then CS:GO, its good for you, and u will like it (probably:D)  So... my opinion is: It´s legendary game, everyone, who likes FPS must have this in his/her:P steam library. :)   ",1,0
10,"Counter-Strike is a pretty old game of 'shooter', which was developed in 1999, and since 2000, supported by Valve. This game immediately caught on millions of players around the world. The game is a confrontation of terrorists and counter-terrorists, representing the forces of good and evil. Objectives of the opposing sides differ depending on the map, in which the battle.  And here is my thoughs...  This is the most entertaining video game i've ever played since 2007. I think i've played this game like 2000hrs i guess, played only the cracked version in that day... I finally i bought this game and it's worth 10 bucks indeed. I still play CS 1.6 because i had an amazing childhood with it! By that i didn't mean online or with bots but i had lots of LAN-party's in my country and my friends still play it though but theres still Lan-party's sometimes in my country ^^ The game is still fun and it never gets boring! I mean todally this game has lots of gamemodes which is ZM/ZE/CSDM/GUNGAME/FURIEN/SURF/DEATHRUN/BASEBUILDER/MIX/PCW/CM/AUTOMIX/BRUSH/ARUSH and more and more and more...

10,"(I've deleted all the comments on this because I wanted to give a serious review about this game and delete my older one, so here ya go)  This is the older Counter-Strike as most people know it. Some people usually don't find enjoyment in playing it due to it being either 'out-dated' or 'glitchy'. I personally tend to enjoy this game from time to time because it's an original game made from the first Source engine, and old school shooters in general ain't too shabby either. Due to the game having a small amount of space to fill in your computer, it rarely ever lags, which makes sure of no interruptions to your enjoyment. It's also just as Competitive as the present Counter-Strike games, though there isn't any seperate Comp gamemode, unfortunately. But that's something that Valve decided to save for later purposes I suppose. Still the King of FPS Games (IMO), I would definetely recommend playing this if you enjoy tactical teamwork in your Online Gaming.",1,0

10,"This will be more of a ''my experience with this game'' type of review, because saying things like ''great gameplay'' will not suit something I've experienced with Counter-Strike. Here you go:  I remember back in 2002 I was at a friend's house and he was playing a game. I didn't know the name of the game nor I had internet to find it. A few weeks passed by and another friend came over and he didn't have a computer, so he brought a disc with a game in it. He told me that it was one of the best games and from that very moment I knew that it is going to be the game I saw at the other friend's house. When I saw the Counter-Strike logo I was filled with gamegasm (?) and I was so happy. I don't remember a day when I was so happy like back then. So, the journey started. I was playing it hardcore. Made friends, clans, was involved in communities and even made two myself. Counter-Strike is my first game which I played competitively and it was a whole experience. Playing public servers and maybe some servers with mods was very fun, but playing it competitively made it very intense and stressful. In a pleasant way, ofcourse.  Shooters these days try to be different, advanced in a way. Sometimes the most simple games like Counter-Strike are the ones that live to this day. Also, there are plenty of mods to keep your attention to this game. The gameplay is very simple - defend as a Counter-Terrorist, attack as a Terrorist to plant the bomb or save the hostages as a CT. I am sure most of you already know this and I doubt there are gamers that haven't heard or know the gameplay of Counter-Strike, so I am sharing here more of my experience.  I wish I could find my CS Anthology account which I've lost since 2008. So, I decided I am going to buy this game again and here you go - more than a thousand hours played. I still play it from time to time to this day and it brings back many great memories and I sometimes even stumble upon people I've played with years ago. I think Counter-Strike changed gaming in a major way and we wouldn't have many games like we have today, if this game wouldn't exist.   I am sure many of people already have played games like CS:GO, but never the roots. I doubt any of you will play it for more than an hour, because it's much more simple and it differs a lot in my opinion from CS:GO and modern games.",1,0

10,"Well, here it is. Some call it 'the mother of shooters', some call it 'bullsh*t'. Well, I can´t tell, whether you will like it, but the fact is, that it started one of the first big shooter franchises ever.   Pros:  -awesome gameplay -awesome gunplay -nostalgia -teambased -mechanics   Cons:  -a bit outdated though   I myself like the classic Counter Strike, but I think there should be big Skillbased MatchMaking Sites like FaceIt or ESEA (if possible even free ones), because the Competetive Mode from Global Offensive is pretty good (even though sometimes it sucks with its rank system).  I think, that it is a great game, but perhaps some players will be put off by the old graphics, but these are pretty good, if you imagine, that this game is about 16 years old.

So why CS 1.6 is dead? I beg to differ. According to spectators IEM 6 CS was the best in the tournament. I think CS 1.6 hardly died, she would die only if we want to do! As for CS: GO it grows, developers even began to read the 'Feedback', the game has changed a lot of things. Open Beta -version of the game was to be released after the new year, but I think the developers have not yet sufficiently satisfied with the result.

So I ran it through my decoder machine. And it came out as this lonely message: Trump did 7/11.  What could it mean? I'm not really sure. I'll keep you guys posted.   UPDATE #2: I've done extensive research, and it appears that this decoded message either means that Donald J. Trump owns a large chain of convenience stores, or that he is an international terrorist threat. At this point I'm not entirely sure which it is. If you have insight into this topic, please reach me at  xXilluminartyboizXx@internetexplorer.com . Thanks.   UPDATE #3: This might be my final update. I found a note slipped into my underwear when I woke up this morning. It was adressed from Valve. I opened it, naturally. Inside was one, simple sentence: Trump sees all.   Guys, listen, I don't know for sure if Trump did 7/11, or he made ISIS, or anything, but it's been fun trying to figure it out. If I don't make it to another update, and they get to me first, just tell my hamster Poochins that I loved him. Peace out.",1,1

10,"This game STILL continue to live on, but why was that? Well it was quite due to that fact that CS:Source isn't that much like by the pros since 2004 as CS:S as quoted: 'Too easy' and such, so the match for cs 1.6 grew more and more and that it was so hyped and praised and good, it still have matches even after 10 years of its 1.6 release (2003 - 2013) in which just kind of died out for CS:GO, but still, because of it's core gameplay and the fact that the commuity has been long just playing this multiplayer long and long and long, it is a game that will take long to die out, since it has a strong community base for it.  Since this game has been, well for long, then you should commonly see the use of wallhacking, cheats, aimbot, fake servers been used today, and the fact that there are quite a lot of empty servers now, but there are populated servers that are good and good community, but there are part of the community been off ever since.  It is seem a bit late to just buy and play this game, but it is still great to check it out if you are new to the cs series, or otherwise if you don't have GNU/Linux (In which I have), then you can buy Counter Strike : Globle Offensive anyway, since it is newer and (I think) has more players and pros playing it now. But if you want to have this raw action, then cs 1.6/cz would be great, you can get the bundle too if you want source as well, but source is fun to play as well.

10,"I'll remind you: I've played CS 1.6 into oblivion on another account. 101 hours is not the full representation of my gameplay in this game.   CS 1.6 is a classic game everybody almost knows what is, at least if you are an FPS player. Of course today it is very outdated and not something you would otherwise play as your main game, but it certainly is something to take a walk through every once in a while - especially as a trip down memory lane or as a fun little LAN game to take your mind off modern games, which can get tiresome after a while (at least in my honest opinion.)   I can definitely recommend this. I played it a lot, and all the while, despite my review of it, CS:CZ had an end consensus that was a better smooth gameplay somewhat, this is one of the best games of all time. At least in terms of the FPS genre. No doubt. But if you were to play it today, you'd have to be patient as the only people still playing this online are either veterans, somewhat experienced people or cheaters (on VAC-insecure servers which there also is quite a lot of.) If you're lucky, you might still find that some of the best servers that kept the community going might still be up. Maybe.   Tread carefully, but definitely try it.",1,0

Your role affects your team's success. Your team's success affects your role.  Gameplay Counter-Strike is a round based game where you play as counter terrorist or play as terrorist. As a counter terrorist, your task is to prevent the terrorist from planting a bomb and detonate it or rescue a captured hostages and lead them to the hostage rescue zone, while the terrorist team has to do the opposite. Weapons has hard recoil so you can't just spray and pray, short burst fire can save you in critical situation. Before the round begins, you can and need to buy weapons and equipments with money, you get money by winning the round or killing the enemy team. This type of gameplay encourages team work.

10,"I'm not one to criticise a game but, this has to be a great title mostly for it's 'Your role affects your team's success. Your team's success affects your role,' system even if it had many problems. The gameplay is great with plenty of user created content to play. Vanilla gameplay is not advised as it gets repetitive fast. Overall gameplay is a 8.5 out of ten. The sound isn't very good with it's annoying tracks, the only way to fix this is to download custom gun sounds but thats a pain. The sound wasn't even good in 2000 when the game came out and thats telling you something. Overall 4.0 out of a possible ten. I know this is odd for me to review a game off of this but online community. The community if few and far between, there are BARELY any good servers up and sometimes the community is awful. (still not as bad as team fortress 2 IMO XD) Overall 6.0 out of ten. Graphics usually take the backseat in my reviews but, I do have to say the graphics are OK I mean in 2000 they still weren't as good as UNREAL 1 or IDTECH 3 but they get the job done. Overall 6.5 out of ten. My verdict is that this game is good and still is I have to say this is a damn fine game earning my score as an 80% out of 100% (BTW This is all criticism because, I AM A CRITIC.)

My childhood and maybe later would be my adulthood also being spent on it. The amount of mods/servers are unbelievable! all of them are amazing as I tried them all. I can't deny that I am addicted to it but, yet! It's hella worth to re-born and be played like the past times! Tournaments and more. I can't withstand the ignorance of valve to it's amazing old games! Just remember that before cs go came out, your success was not in CS:S or CS:CZ it was all in this game. &lt;3",1,0

The e-sport scene also helped it alot, it's the only computer game I've really followed when it comes to e-sports (back when I followed the CPL etc). The design of the game was simple but very effective and delivered a multiplayer experience that few other games can match. The Call of Duty and Battlefield titles, although good in their own right, never drew me in like Counter-Strike.",1,1

10,"1999 is when this came out, but when I was born. Gladly though I grew up to find out and discover about this magnificent piece. There was no other game that I played once I purchased this with some B-Day cash on Steam. First time playing, I got mutilated like the noob I was, but when I started playing more often, I became better and everyone else can too.   This isn't like the CODs or Battlefields that I have played here and there today. No it's much more different. Counter-Strike is a Tactical FPS which relies on teamwork and tactics more than fast paced arcade action. You don't unlock weapons, you buy them with cash earned from kiling enemies, completeing objectives, or winning rounds although you still get a little for loosing. Think of the game as Cops &amp; Robbers. Robbers blow things up and the Cops don't them too.  On the extra note, this game has probably one of the best modding communities out there. There too much to do or put in here but I can slam a bit down. -Zombies Survival/Escape -Soccer (Or Football for the Europeans) -Surf -Bhop/KZ (Climbing Zone) -Pokemod -Gungame (Those new may have heard such from Call of Duty's spinoff) -And more, etc.  So now that I've explained the game I guess I can lay down some pro's yet con's to playing Counter-Strike 1.6  PROS -Fun/Unlimited Gameplay possibilities -Booming community that has been alive for 15 years -Plethora of servers to choose from -Competetive and Casual at the same time -Fun to play with a group of friends -More skill based than many other games out there -Cheap price   CONS -Graphics from 1998 may seem slightly offputting -Not an easy game to jump right into, as it takes lots of time to become better -May seem repetitive after a while  I came into CS late. But, I'm glad this was the first one I owned.",1,0

Then somebody made a cheat, and destroyed a game. This game changed many lives, many people. I think this game become the world best game ever. For me, it's the best game. I play it every day, but it isn't like sometimes. Now graphic is important. Well, it isn't. I know that this game is dead already... I want to get it back, but there is no way to do that.  Cheaters are everywhere now. In every single game. You can buy cheat for CS:GO for 5$ I think... My friend bought it. I asked him : ' Why did you bought that ? Isn't it better to enjoy playing the game without cheats? ' He told me: ' I want to beat everyone. I want to be the best. No one can stop me now. '  I don't know why are you doing it, this is beautiful game. When I played it for the first time, it was awesome :D Finally a game that I can play with my friends on LAN. And, till today, I'm playing it. I never downloaded a cheat. I don't need that. I want to learn how to play, to be the beast in the world... Now everyone is wanting money, money money... I heard about CS:GO Lounge aka CS GO betting site. Now everyone is watching matches because of skins, to get free money... Well, when I was young, in 2005. I waited with my friends a CS 1.6 match. It was beautiful. Now i sit here, and watch this CS:GO matches... So many people watch matches... But 90% watch them because of f***ing bet...  It will never be like sometimes...

10,"Counter-Strike - a series of computer games in the genre of team first-person shooter based on the engine GoldSource, originally appeared as a modification of Half-Life games.  You have to compare, so this game I will compare with СS: Source and CS: Global Offensive    Pros:    1. Battle PVP.   The multiplayer game is fully revealed the potential of the idea of the game. The most interesting part of this is. Under the bot can already tune in, but not in the real players. They can deceive, to negotiate, to use cunning tactics to create unusual ambushes.   2. The atmosphere and realism.   In all games, Valve is always a great atmosphere and I was impressed. It is evident that the developers have tried to do everything in this game, as in real life. For example, the sounds. Unfortunately, Valve released a patch in Counter-Strike: Global Offensive with new sounds and they made a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.       Minuses:    1. Cheaters.   Well, as without these ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s? These sons of dogs prevent us from playing. Creators of cheats have always been one step ahead of the creators of the VAC anti-cheat. Valve is trying to improve its anti-cheat and have it turns out.I say that Valve do nothing, not worth it.   2.Graphic arts.   She was good at Counter-Strike as long as did not come out Source. I'm not picky about graphics, but after 30 minutes I start to hurt your eyes. Yes, and in general, this game proved to all that the graphics in games are not the most important thing.   3.Termination of support.   All good things always come to an end, and Counter-Strike is not an exception. The game goes more and more players, server empty.More Valve does not release an update for Counter-Strike and does not support it in e-sports.     Conclusion:     Despite the fact that in this game there are downsides, even if they have, but still this game is legendary.  If you ask me, as you Counter-Strike, the fond memories flooding back me, maybe I can cry .Game, which was able to give me a lot of positive emotions..  ",1,0

If you haven't played HL original it make look a little stupid, but the game is still great inside. Original can't get more original here -- when talking about the base game idea(s).

We have CSGO now, it would be ridiculous to pick up a old, outdated and dying game like CS 1.6. Those who play it do so cause they've been doing it for 15+ years, but no new players arrive and it is too much blocky graphically to be even considered for purchase these days.  Great game, but too old/outdated and dying. Don't recommend, unless you're here to get some nostalgia from the old days.

It was my first multiplayer game and I though I'm too new to play against players so I played only with bots slowly progressing from easy to to the hard ones. Then one day I joined a Dust II DM server. It was chaotic, but fun. I didn't even know the map then, but I learned it by playing lots of DM. I slowly climbed the integrated server ranks and made friends with one of the admins...then after a while the server disappeared.  After that I found out about deathrun. I was horrible at it, but the regulars helped me and I started visiting the server more and more. Apparently the same server chain had a gun game server too. Now that was amazing. Completely different people played there, but again friendly ones. After a couple of months the server chain was shut down...  I continued playing aim, awp, jailbreak and other mods. I didn't even play the classic mode, it wasn't of that big interest to me, though after a couple of months I stopped playing CS.  I can't not recommend this game, because I have so many memories from it. Nostalgia.",1,0

This game is the true tactical FPS multiplayer, many new games with fancy graphics try to accomplish what CS 1.6 did and fail terribly.  1.6 needs more love from valve, it was one of the games that made steam a 'thing', hell, back in the day it was the ONLY game to bring loyal users to the platform, the games available at the time were very reduced and steam was just an annoyance, to be completely honest we all hated steam, it was a broken nightmare.  Valve could show some love for their baby... adding trading cards, bg's and emo's or even skins would be a great start... one call only dream.. :)  tl;dr: Steam was very broken and the 1.6 playerbase kept it going, valve should recognize that.",1,0

10,"-This is my opinion your experience may vary-  counter strike a name that almost anyone will recognize. Before I played counter strike I knew that it was a game loved by thousands even millions and that people play it every day.  =The Graphics=  this game's graphics are good (IMO) and it may not look to good by todays standards, they hold up just fine.  =The Gameplay=  The gameplay in Counter Strike involves starting out with some money to buy equipment, you earn more mony by killing members on the opposing team rescuing hostages, deactivating bombs, or plant and explode the bomb, also 1 life per round so work together.  =My Verdict=  I love this game the people who play it are pretty cool most of the time and the game can really suck you in and $10 may be kinda steep in for a game this old but it comes with  -Counter Strike -Counter Strike: Condition Zero -Counter Strike: Condition Zero Deleted Scenes  wich all come in the $10 asking price and I would give this game a 9/10",1,0

(Global Offensive, even while taking changes as they come, is the new favorite goose-- Carrying the Law of Newer, Faster, Bolder-- But even there, the core CS spirit &amp; experience is true. And always slowly evolving...)   It's good to look back at how far this franchise has come, as even with each controversial change or update, I know each decision is calculated with the desire to keep moving forward-- While  (hopefully)  staying as true to it's core as possible.

10,"Half-Life: Counter-Strike contains all the elements of the popular online multiplayer game originally built as an add-on for Half-Life. The team-based gameplay divides you into terrorist or antiterrorist squads.

The 2 things that suck about the game is the people that play in 5v5 servers don't speak english and I get kicked not knowing why. And the spray patterns dont have 1 specific pattern to each gun, after the first 5 bullets there are 12 different patterns the bullets can go",1,0

10,"This will be more of a ''my experience with this game'' type of review, because saying things like ''great gameplay'' will not suit something I've experienced with Counter-Strike. Here you go:  I remember back in 2002 I was at a friend's house and he was playing a game. I didn't know the name of the game nor I had internet to find it. A few weeks passed by and another friend came over and he didn't have a computer, so he brought a disc with a game in it. He told me that it was one of the best games and from that very moment I knew that it is going to be the game I saw at the other friend's house. When I saw the Counter-Strike logo I was filled with gamegasm (?) and I was so happy. I don't remember a day when I was so happy like back then. So, the journey started. I was playing it hardcore. Made friends, clans, was involved in communities and even made two myself. Counter-Strike is my first game which I played competitively and it was a whole experience. Playing public servers and maybe some servers with mods was very fun, but playing it competitively made it very intense and stressful. In a pleasant way, ofcourse.  Shooters these days try to be different, advanced in a way. Sometimes the most simple games like Counter-Strike are the ones that live to this day. Also, there are plenty of mods to keep your attention to this game. The gameplay is very simple - defend as a Counter-Terrorist, attack as a Terrorist to plant the bomb or save the hostages as a CT. I am sure most of you already know this and I doubt there are gamers that haven't heard or know the gameplay of Counter-Strike, so I am sharing here more of my experience.  I wish I could find my CS Anthology account which I've lost since 2008. So, I decided I am going to buy this game again and here you go - more than a thousand hours played. I still play it from time to time to this day and it brings back many great memories and I sometimes even stumble upon people I've played with years ago. I think Counter-Strike changed gaming in a major way and we wouldn't have many games like we have today, if this game wouldn't exist.  I am sure many of people already have played games like CS:GO, but never the roots. I doubt any of you will play it for more than an hour, because it's much more simple and it differs a lot in my opinion from CS:GO and modern games.  I am glad that I lived through the golden era of shooters and if I'd have to rate it, it'd 10/10 ofcourse,",1,0

10,"Good old times when i played this game for the first time. I had 5 years old when i tried this game for the first time. As you know, this game is a modification of Half-Life by developers and it's a multiplayer first-person shooter. You don't have iron sight how you have in CoD or other shooter games + you need to know the weapons because they don't shoot where is the aim. It's hard to explain, but this game has so many modes and is awesome because if you buy this game, you will receive Counter-Strike Condition Zero and Condition Zero Deleted Scenes for FREE. You can play a normal shooter games with instant respawn or without it, but you can also play deathrun, surf, bhop, gun game, zombies and so on.  Pros: +The multiplayer is great +The sound is good +The graphics are very good for that year +So many play styles +So many maps +The gameplay is hard but great  Cons: -Hackers -Players who will destroy your game -Kids -VIP Servers who will OBLIGATE you to enter on their servers  This game reminded me how was the life when i was younger, so many hours in the front of PC, how i played it with friends and at school, how i ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off for the first time in a game and so on.

10,"Counter-Strike has come a long way and to see this game really brings out how much it has come. I feel as this game is not just a time waster but a reason to still be on the Internet. But In 1999, I crawled out of Counter-Strike’s wretched ♥♥♥♥♥♥ to become the man I am today. And, now, I’m tasked with rating the game. How does one even rate his mother?  In sixth grade, I would wake up for school at 5:30 AM, but then I started getting up at 4:30 just to get a couple rounds in before class. Call it dedication or a sickening obsession, but I was hooked on CS (nevermind my neighbor who broke into my house to play while I slept!) It was more than a game. It was my social hub, my iTunes visualizer, and my brief entryway into game design (which didn’t go very far.) It is and remains a standout multiplayer shooter that paved the way for things to come with Call of Duty and Battlefield.  Being eight years since the excellent Source remake, Valve has decided it’s time to give the game another facelift. What started as a Source port for consoles became a more ambitious project that included PC. While there are no radical departures in Global Offensive, it is without a doubt a reboot. Valve has just hit the reset button on the series, once again. As drastic and premature of a maneuver it may be, there is no denying that Counter-Strike remains an addictive and rewarding competitive shooter like no other.  In sixth grade, I would wake up for school at 5:30 AM, but then I started getting up at 4:30 just to get a couple rounds in before class.

10,"Advantages: a good idea, an opportunity to play on a network Disadvantages: poor performance, graphics, textures, defects. Collection of my reviews on video games continues. Today we will speak about the most famous first-person shooter 'Counter-Strike'.  Igrushechki this appeared quite a long time, already in the year 2000 and won the gamers. Then all these 'shooters' were a novelty, and of course all like this game. I knew about it a long time, I heard enthusiastic talks about it, heard the word 'bots', 'contra', 'headshot of', 'ks'. And what is it, I managed to learn five or six years ago. Games then I was not 'tempted', but even then I have appreciated this game for three and a minus. Why? I'll explain later. Now the whole of the game. Created her notorious guys with the short name 'Valve'. About 'Valve's' I will say this: all of their games on the subject stopped 'fantasy' and 'half-real.' And this game belongs to the second category.  So, the creators of the idea is quite tempting. Confrontation of the law against terrorists. They gave the game the proud name of 'Counter-Strike', ie 'counter-attack', but that's just shock, as such, no intrigue in this game. And that is? There are running with a gun, a gun, a knife. Oh yes, there is another grenade (use 0). And you can take the shield (not a bad thing). We can play for the 'special forces' (which I did) and terror (very few people want). Most probably the main thing here is that we can play a 'bot' that is, our friends runs the computer, the computer runs our enemies, but we can play and through the network, where all have real people. Play over the Internet more interesting, but still 'stupid'.  I do not want to talk about any reality or fiction, but all I will say. I have not seen, not in movies, not in life, to special forces, and the terrorists jumped as the 'hare', climbed the stairs, as if running on the ground. And finally, it is that even the slightest preparation is absent, the men can not hit no shield, no weapons, no arms / legs. The hostages, but here too there are, behave calmly, stand, no one is afraid of fear or cry.  So, I criticized a little, and now tell you about the features. Game modes are different, rescuing hostages, rescue VIP-a, defusing a bomb, knife, grenade. A quest we give money, we buy ourselves, that it is necessary, for example, body armor (a rare case when it is not worn in advance on fighter (in reality)). On the job, we allocated time, which is usually enough. Each of the men says that he wants and commands that it is possible to give no one is listening. By the way, there you can sprinkle a logo that can be selected in advance. Beauty is not gaining.",1,0

10,"Lemme teach you about the Counter-Strike family history: Counter-Strike 1.6 was the eldest son. As he grew up, people came to love him as a good-hearted, generous man that was perfect in every way. As he grew older and older, the public came to appreciate the work he put in for everybody else and he soon became a household name. Him and his followers became very eccentric and stuck to the old ways. Counter-Strike: Source was the middle child. Everybody expected him to follow in his brother's footsteps but somewhere he went wrong. CS:S was a damn sight nicer than 1.6 and he was still loved by many but never achieved as much as his elder brother did, always in his shadow. Counter-Strike: Global Offensive was the youngest child. CS:GO was the child that Gooseman and Cliffe became ashamed of. They tried to hide the fact that CS:GO was completely ♥♥♥♥ing autistic but eventually it seeped out and now masses have come to love him, even though 1.6 is the best.",1,1

10,"This will be more of a ''my experience with this game'' type of review, because saying things like ''great gameplay'' will not suit something I've experienced with Counter-Strike. Here you go:  I remember back in 2010 I was at a friend's house and he was playing a game. I didn't know the name of the game nor I had internet to find it. A few weeks passed by and another friend came over. He didn't have a computer, so he brought a disc with a game in it. He told me that it was one of the best games and from that very moment I knew that it is going to be the game I saw at the other friend's house. When I saw the Counter-Strike logo I was filled with gamegasm (?) and I was so happy. I was playing it hardcore. Made friends, clans, was involved in communities and even made two myself. Counter-Strike is my first game which I played competitively and it was a such an experience. Playing public servers with mods were very fun, but playing it competitively made it very intense and stressful. In a pleasant way, ofcourse. Looking at the current e-sport scene it might not seem like much but back then it was different.  Shooters these days try to be different, advanced in a way. Sometimes the most simple games like Counter-Strike are the ones that live to this day. Also, there are plenty of mods to keep your attention to this game. The gameplay is very simple - defend as a Counter-Terrorist, attack as a Terrorist to plant the bomb or save the hostages as a CT. I am sure most of you already know this and I doubt there are gamers that haven't heard or know the gameplay of Counter-Strike, so I am sharing here more of my experience.  I wish I could find my CS Anthology account which I've lost since 2012. So, I decided I am going to buy this game again and here you go - more than a thousand hours played. I still play it from time to time to this day and it brings back many great memories and I sometimes even stumble upon people I've played with years ago. I think Counter-Strike changed gaming in a major way and we wouldn't have many games like we have today, if this game wouldn't exist.   I am sure many of people already have played games like CS:GO but never the roots. I doubt any of you will play it for more than an hour, because it's much more simple and it differs a lot in my opinion from CS:GO and modern games. It's harder though.",1,1

10,"Words cannot explain how great this game is. Upon the release of Half-Life, I was privileged enough to have this game (as well as Team Fortress Classic) come included with the game. I played both A LOT more then I did with Half-Life which I felt no need in playing again after beating it and the multiplayer left a lot to be desired. TFC brought me many great years of fun but like so many great games in the past, it just mysteriously died out and now I am anticipating the release of TFC2 next year. Counter-Strike, however, still has yet to die. Infact, it is a still ever growing community and easily the most popularly played FPS out today and still will be for quite some time, at least till CS 1.7 is released (if ever). I began playing this amazing game from the day the much anticipated Half-Life was released and haven't stopped since. I was what you would call a *pubmaster* for several years where I'd just walk into a pub and have fun pwning noobs but for pure enjoyment. The following years, a friend and I got into competitive play and joined CALeague. The rest, I guess you can say is history. I've played many seasons of CAL and yes, I've been out of CAL-O for several seasons (only played open for two seasons).  All in all, this game is still easily the best FPS out there even after 7 years. Pick it up, and you won't be disappointed. Do not be fooled about CS: Source, thinking it is better or that it is the future of Counter-Strike simply because it is newer. It's a really, really bad game.",1,0

10,"this game is juste, simply, clearly perfect, no game could ever get any close to it, i have CS:GO and yet i enjoy a lot more cs 1.6 then CS:GO  good points: - a classic but amazing gameplay suited for thousands and thousands of fun playing - a load of modifications and moded servers with a multitude of skins for best looking game possible (like Zm mod,ZE or BaseBuilder....) - low requirements for it, but yet it allows to play with soooo many people on internet on many servers, as anybody could run this game - very amazing low download size making it pretty much portable (400~Mb of download is still much less then other games) - and ofc, the nice spent hours with friends killing each others as well as working together (RIP to old friendships broken by this game too :P) - diversity of communities to enjoy a sociable envirement and getting new friends Bad points: - graphisme are not good for those who are getting used to nowadays games (some people might overcome this point by simply loving the simplicity of the game) - presence of annoying cheaters on servers and the small management of such problems - no single player mode and even if you fight bots, its not fun.  i think thats all for my review, i've been playing this game for like 4 years now and i still freaking enjoy it and i really recommand it to anyone with powerfull and low pc, it creates unbreakable friendship relations :v",1,1

10,"There's been a lot said about this game already, so...I'll say some more anyway, both about this entry and about the entire series.  Counter-Strike was created as a modification for  Half-Life  and quickly took on a life of its own, eventually meriting a standalone release by Valve. Its development process more or less invented the concept of the public beta. At one point around its public release, Internet traffic for the original surpassed the entire traffic output of Italy. The game itself across all its iterations can be described as easy to learn yet hard to master, like so many good games. Unlike chess and  go  however, CS primarily revolves around shooting people.  On the surface, it's simple. Counter-terrorists must stop terrorists from planting a bomb at a strategic location, or rescue hostages that the terrorists are holding. There's a handful of other modes included with the original, but they're almost never played. Players earn money over each round (more for winning and killing) to purchase more suitable guns and equipment.  In practice, rounds can sometimes end with one team being killed before any objectives can be seen to. Apart from a couple of series quirks that people have learned to love - or exploit, if they're Actual Pro Gamers(tm) - CS is pretty realistic. One shot, one kill and all of that. (No real story either, either explicit or in subtext.)   One thing CS has going for it that I haven't seen mentioned much is that you can play in bite-sized chunks if you want to. As far as I know, the reasons for it not being mentioned much are that the latest game ( Global Offensive ) has a competitive mode that encourages playing for entire matches, and that more dedicated players will often play for hours. Strictly speaking, I recommend playing in chunks: CS can get tense and difficult depending on your skill and the skill of your opposition.  However, the pacing is such that it's not exactly the hyperactive bulletfest most of today's shooters are: matches can end up as deadly games of cat and mouse as often as they erupt into firefights. Related is the fact that there is no prestige (apart from matchmaking rankings in Global Offensive) or killstreaks or what have you for players to literally level the playing field with. It can be frustrating to miss an opponent's head by a hair only for them to not miss in turn, or to be oneshotted out of the blue, but it's reassuring to know that skill is the primary factor here.  Another interesting thing is the individualism you usually see on display. Most players, especially Real Pro Gamers(tm), place a high emphasis on very skilled aiming, but a well-coordinated team that knows how to position themselves on a given map will generally have a big advantage against a team of lone wolf headshotters. CS doesn't exactly encourage team play or punish a lack of it like  Insurgency , but I will. (Encourage it, not punish the lack of it. (Much.))   This particular entry in the series still holds up; its aesthetic is more classic than dated, and you get the no-frills base gameplay that made the series what it is. If you're looking to get into the series I would still recommend  Source  or the cheaper, more modern (albeit probably more toxic) Global Offensive over this, but that's more a matter of preference and polish.  The main advantage this first entry has over the rest of its series is that you can play it on pretty much any computer these days, although Source is only a  little  more punishing on today's computers. There's a fair amount of mediocre (if somewhat classic) maps and no default bot support, but unlike the beautified expansion-slash-sequel  Condition Zero , you'll still find a lot of people in multiplayer; even more than in Source!  Please avoid Counter-Strike Nexon: Zombies though. It may be based off this game, but it is bad.",1,0
10,"Counter-Strike is the mainstay of competitive shooters, with the kind of prestige the likes of Call of Duty strives so hard to achieve. A number of gameplay modes ranging from what used to be the highly popular VIP to the traditional hostage and bomb maps, to eventually leading directly to two now-released sequels and one upcoming release leaves plenty to keep one busy.  'Remember your roots.'  With simple designs to keep things tight and easy to practice (yet nearly impossible to master), Counter-Strike proves that a good shooter can stay in the forefront for over a decade.",1,0

10,"This game is a timeless classic. It's one of the perfect FPS' that will ever be made. The movement, wall spamming, hitboxes, and map choices are what make this game the best. I've been playing this game since around 2003. Have played tournaments, been an admin for many clans, and strat caller for matches. This game takes serious skill to get good at. There is a huge learning curve, and that's what seperates this from other games, and noobs and pro's. The people who will get good at this game, are the ones who put the time and effort to learn everything. While the game can be a pick up and play game. Expect your ♥♥♥ to get handed to you, as veterans of the game still heavily play this, and they'll out shoot you 9/10 times. I have been called a cheater countless times in this game, and it all comes from me playing this day and night as a child, and my skills has also transferred into other FPS games. If you get good at CS, you'll more than likely be very good at other FPS games like Over Watch, CoD, 007, etc. Thats why I nominate this game for, The “Test of Time” Award. My friends think I'm dumb for playing a game developed in the 90's, but there's a reason for it. As I said, this game is the perfect FPS. It's a game I will play until I die. I can buy any new game on the market, and I'll be returning to this game shortly after. Take it from someone who has invested a lot of time in this game to get good. It's going to seem scary at first, as you will get rekt. But you will develop friends from within the various communities, and you will get better over time. And this skill set will make you better at other FPS games. CS 1.6 forever!",1,0

10,"Life is one .. CS is 1.6 only . I will not say it is the most fav game of mine . But it doesn't strive to be the most fav game of anyone . My fav game has to be GTA ! The thing why we all love this game and we all feel the urge to say this is the most fav game is that once this game starts , the human element takes over and we actually game with our friends ( and strangers) and that's what gives us the enjoyment; the feel of competitiveness and who is the best ; to be in awe of some good player and the list goes on . The game itself is not great but the way in which it just lets the human element takes over and be the silent spectator as we enjoy and have a good time , just speaks volumes of the greatness of this game ! The game is like a silent Guardian which governs us as we enjoy our life in the 1.6 way ! GG",1,0

Every server you visit has the charming alure of Mexicans and Brazillians; an honorable bunch of players who praise your skills with phrases such as 'filho da ♥♥♥♥!!!!!!', 'xiter!!!' and 'jajajajaja'. They are also very skilled players ingame; I often see a single player moving at the speed of sound, headshotting everyone in a blink of an eye, and getting all the praise from his fellow brethren, usually in the form of 'xiter fdp!!!'.

10,"Counter-Strike destroyed my life. I had been playing HL deathmatch, and was waiting for team fortress 2 (some of those early TF2 screens are still etched in my brain) I came across a new mod called Counter-Strike, it had just been released, Beta 1 there were only 3 maps I think and the player models were so similar that in the darkend corridors of Mansion you couldn't see who was what, so there was team killing galore, even a console command for extra money, but it was awesome, I'd never played anything like it. So I played it. ALLOT. I'd come in from college stick it on and play untill I was ready for bed, screw school work I had people to shoot in the face! Anyway I failed my A-levels and got stuck with crappy jobs, but looking back, it could possibly have been worth it, because damn I had fun! I don't know what its like nowadays, I did get fed up with the bunnyhopping AWP gits and from what I gather that is the way the game went, but this was it, where it started for me, and if you haven't played it once then you should just so you know where all your call of duty and all that balls came from.",1,0

10,"Counter-Strike is a first-person shooter in which players join either the terrorist team, the counter-terrorist team, or become spectators. Each team attempts to complete their mission objective and/or eliminate the opposing team. Each round starts with the two teams spawning simultaneously.  The objectives vary depending on the type of map, and these are the most usual ones:  Bomb Maps: The terrorists must carry a bomb, plant it on one of the designated spots and protect it from being disarmed by the counter-terrorists before it explodes to win. The counter-terrorists win if the time runs out with no conclusion. Hostage Maps: The counter-terrorists must rescue a group of hostages held by the terrorists to win. The terrorists win if the time runs out with no conclusion. VIP Maps: One of the counter-terrorists is chosen to act as a VIP and the team must escort this player to a designated spot on the map to win the game. The terrorists win if the VIP is killed or if the time runs out with no conclusion.",1,0

10,"Best game known to man-kind. No enhanced engine captures the reality of this original. 1.5 was even better. Per. Head-shot boxes have NEVER been the same and since VAC I miss seeing the cheaters getting caught Red-Handed and added to the International blacklist. I still keep a black book of every IP at the scene of any crimes. If you want to experience the original AWP trying playing OP4. Shoot opponent in the hand or foot and they are toast! If you are still mad that 'they' Cliff and whoever took the silencer off the Colt I got the SOB back. Visit  ANTPLA.NET  to get skin pack II. Original was from ~01 and is still downloadable as General Sphinx Brothers of Steel BOS skin pack. I was there playing UK's Ganstawars Last Man Standing Gameplay type messing with the bots skins trying to get CS skins on Gangstawar bots and enjoyed how one of them was invisible. Sort of like a prank. If you can tommygun invisible opponent you are like a Luke Skywalker bad a$$. Skin pack II has the 'Starwars' lightsaber replacement for knife and the AK to plasma rifle from 1980's movie 'Alien'. The skins out compete CSGO any day of the week with 400fps instead of stuck on 30 same kernel. I got a duo-core up to 1200fps. Well I should not have shared the knowlege with other gamers on the map because next thing you know everybody was doing it on their own character. [AU] DeathWish settled it when it got to CS with rainbow coloured animated reskins instead of them being invisible. My first game was CS Canyon_Siege and I was wondering why we all were moving around as ghost spectators. I am not the Prodigy Inc SPHINX. I have only made auto-admin called 3 forms of punishment. It was for Admin Mod then re-written for AMX. Lost. No need for it anymore anyway. People still found a way to hack with it and fly around the maps prior to hook and vote for matrix, etc. Give them enough rope and instead of being slapped, killed, kicked, ban was in effect for short period. Essentially you mixed 2 words with lag and server and other various buZz words like gay server all these got punishments set fourth. Talking crap about admin was a slaying. Lag was a slap. It was based off Trinity and the server was the spirit. If trash talk is about the 'spirit', that is not forgivable or rather as tolerated and the ban was automatically set. That resolved major breach of security. Suddenly there is no need to have tons of admins. Most of whom were there just to exploit code often unintentionally, due to buggy 3rd party plug-ins such as STATSME.",1,0

10,"Counter-Strike...  This game is the reason to why I got a Steam account in the first place. I got this game six years ago from a near friend of mine. Everytime I was at his place we used to play this together in turns; he played for a while, maybe 2-3 deaths then I played. We had such a great time. But... the problem was that outside his house we couldn't play the game together.   At the time my dad didn't allow me to buy the game, so my friend ended up giving it to me as a christmas present. Since that day we played it all the time. One of our favorite servers was Eropid (HS Only). He (my friend) ended up beeing in 4-5 place for a while on the server.   Overall, I've had a great time playing this game, and still enjoy playing it today. The game was the start to my FPS gaming interest and since then I've bought every CS released.  I recommed this game to anyone who wants to start play FPS games; as it is a great starting game. I also recommend that you play it with your friends; that way you will get the most fun out of it!

10,"Counter-Strike: Source, Counter-Strike: Condition Zero and Counter-Strike: Global Offensive are great games but let's not forget about the original one, the one that made them, that without it, they probably wouldn't exist or would be different, this, this game is a gem I tell you. Now, you'll ask, why play this game when we have Source and Global Offensive? The answer is simple, either for nostalgia or to see how great this game was back in the time and where it all started, of course, the game version is 1.6 so it is not the oldest version but it does not matters, there could be many reasons to play this game, It got maps that aren't on Source and/or Global Offensive, It has a riot shield (even if I'm not too fan of this tactical item in Multiplayer games) and a different gameplay than CS:GO and Source, If you think Source is hard because of the recoil, of course, it's pretty similar to Source but it's a little different (or maybe It is just me) but anyway, you will get used to it quick, It's not like it was Arma... or real life.  I would suggest it to any Counter-Strike, semi-tactical, counter terrorists and FPS fans (except for those who are COD hardcore fanboys but who knows, you may change and prefer Counter-Strike to COD).

10,"Comparing the game to CS:GO.    Pros:      Variation in lighting (darker rooms), along with flashlights and nightvision.    No background/ambient sounds in most maps (clear sound) (easier to hear footsteps and gunfire).    You can wallbang most things/walls in most maps.    Buying amunition (more depth in economical strategy).    MP5 ('nuff said)    Movement is much smoother and bunnyhopping is much more consistant and fluent, you feel much heavier in cs:go.    You can run the game on a toaster.    Character selection (I just think its pretty awesome).    Spraying (spray paint), boobs make for a great strategical distraction.    Customizing textures, maps, models ect. is great, you can mod almost anything you want, unlike in CS:GO.    No marketing system (skins), this one is a bit of a debate, personally I'm ok with skins (I've even spent money on it myself), but I prefer to mod a game rather than having to pay for a nice looking gun. Skins, simply put, are a way to milk the players money. Im thankful that CS 1.6 doesn't have this.    CS 1.6 has a classic/nostalgic feel to it, some people will like that, some people won't.    People still play the game, proving the game isn't dead yet.    There are many different and interesting modded game modes in 1.6 such as surfing, zombie, bunny hopping, jailbreak, deathmatch, gungame.     Cons:      Matchmaking in CS:GO is better, it is simpler and places you in a server with people around your level.    Grenade physics are awkward and hard to learn.    Viewing and casting games is much better/easier in CS:GO.    Few weapons are viable in CS 1.6, mostly just the AK, M4, AWP, Deagle and MP5    Sometimes bad/terrible hit registration.    Tactical shield.    No ranking system, personally, I don't care about having a pretty symbols with a bunch of arrows and stars, or having stupid rank names like 'SERGEANT MASTER ELITE SHOOTER PERSON', the only reason I'm putting it on this list is because ranking helps put players with other players that are about the level. In 1.6, any new player will find themselves playing against people leagues better than said player.    I did mention before that modded servers were great, but it can also be a problem, there are few classic CS 1.6 servers that aren't modded, most of them being deathmatch servers with 32 players, it's hard to find normal CS game modes.    Hacking is a issue in CS 1.6, worse than in CS:GO. It's harder to get VAC Banned in 1.6 and there aren't any features like Overwatch in CS:GO, to make it easier to detect hackers.    Servers can change your bindings and send you to other servers, this isn't a big problem as there are ways around it but it's still present.    The game no longer gets any updates, I know this isn't the games fault but there are still exploits and bugs in 1.6.   Some people will agree these pros and cons and some won't. I'm not saying this game is necessarily better than CS:GO, but it sure is a fun experience. I would definately recommend this game to anyone who likes FPS games, especially people who play CS:GO. The game takes a while to get used to but once you do, you will find yourself playing this game for days. I havn't played this game too much, so theres probably a lot I'm missing.

10,"If you like shooting the bad guys then this is one of the games for you. When Counter-Strike was originally released in 2000, I didn't play it because I was like 1 year old. I play it now because of the fast/slow paced actions and the guns. There are a bunch of guns in Counter-Strike that you can use. There are little guns that are cheap, and big guns that are expensive. But here lies the problem with Counter-Strike... people don't even use all of the guns! Whenever I find onto a server, all of the players are only using the black gun, the brown gun, the silver gun, and the green gun. Even though there is a bunch of weapons, they aren't really all used much of the time. In the end, I play Counter-Strike because my computer is afraid of Counter-Strike: Source.",1,0
10,"This game is a very addictive First-Person shooter, which even by its age is still played by thousands of players and I personaly find it very relaxing to its multiplayer and singleplayer capabilities.

10,"If you thought people dont play old games anymore, you're wrong. Counter-Strike is still a game with LOTS of players playing, despite the game being 15 years old so far. If you have a bad PC, dont worry, because Counter-Strike can run on almost any computer!  With excellent controls, skilled players, good graphics (for its time), a big variety of guns, the huge amount of servers, the anti-cheat system, good level design (official maps), Counter-Strike is one of the greatest FPS of all-time, and I think everyone should get this game as it is cheap.   If you are a retrogamer and you never played Counter-Strike yet, you gotta do it. You wont get disapointed. Not at all.  I dont have much to say about Counter-Strike... its just so good... everything about it has already been said by others... what should I say now?   if you think Counter-Strike would be a bad purchase, you're commiting a serious error. Just go play it. Go! Go! Go!",1,0

10,Does this even need a real review?,1,0
10,"This will be more of a ''my experience with this game'' type of review, because saying things like ''great gameplay'' will not suit something I've experienced with Counter-Strike. Here you go:  I remember back in 2002 I was at a friend's house and he was playing a game. I didn't know the name of the game nor I had internet to find it. A few weeks passed by and another friend came over and he didn't have a computer, so he brought a disc with a game in it. He told me that it was one of the best games and from that very moment I knew that it is going to be the game I saw at the other friend's house. When I saw the Counter-Strike logo I was filled with gamegasm (?) and I was so happy. I don't remember a day when I was so happy like back then. So, the journey started. I was playing it hardcore. Made friends, clans, was involved in communities and even made two myself. Counter-Strike is my first game which I played competitively and it was a whole experience. Playing public servers and maybe some servers with mods was very fun, but playing it competitively made it very intense and stressful. In a pleasant way, ofcourse.  Shooters these days try to be different, advanced in a way. Sometimes the most simple games like Counter-Strike are the ones that live to this day. Also, there are plenty of mods to keep your attention to this game. The gameplay is very simple - defend as a Counter-Terrorist, attack as a Terrorist to plant the bomb or save the hostages as a CT. I am sure most of you already know this and I doubt there are gamers that haven't heard or know the gameplay of Counter-Strike, so I am sharing here more of my experience.  I wish I could find my CS Anthology account which I've lost since 2008. So, I decided I am going to buy this game again and here you go - more than a thousand hours played. I still play it from time to time to this day and it brings back many great memories and I sometimes even stumble upon people I've played with years ago. I think Counter-Strike changed gaming in a major way and we wouldn't have many games like we have today, if this game wouldn't exist.  I am sure many of people already have played games like CS:GO, but never the roots. I doubt any of you will play it for more than an hour, because it's much more simple and it differs a lot in my opinion from CS:GO and modern games.  I am glad that I lived through the golden era of shooters and if I'd have to rate it, it'd 10/10 ofcourse,",1,0

And of course, it's the GoldSource Engine and all that entails.  Counter-Strike: Condition Zero is considerably more fun, in my opinion. You get all the same weapons, but there's a pseudo-story mode, AI bots to play with, and different objectives and a variety of maps you hop around, all of them challenging you in new ways. Kind of like the current campaign contracts in Global Offensive and Team Fortress 2.  Get this game (package), especially if it's on sale. If not for the classic-ness (or nostalgia), then get it for the great single-player experience with Condition Zero.",1,0

10,"I do believe this was the first FPS game I ever played and I remembered I really enjoyed it. This was the game who started e-sport growing, with players as Heaton, get_right, etc, and you can really tell how it has embarked the industry and media. CS is the top e-sport game in the world. There is reasons for that!  Great gameplay, voice, maps, gamemodes, servers and many fun things to explore in this old FPS game.   If you want to play serious or just want to have a fun, this game has it. I'd recommend to buy it if you want to be apart and feel like you own something that has revolutionize the gaming industry and the e-sport genre.

10,"Being someone who played CS:GO before this game, I must say I was pleasently suprised. The gameplay was great, and the community was quite helpful and much less toxic. I love Half Life, and this is very similar. Really fun to just do some deathmatch, I find it to be much more enjoyable then CS:GO. The bullets go where you shoot them, and hit reg is not awful. There is a much greater spread of maps here then in GO, and they are all great. The visuals and core gameplay are so simple, while providing incredible room for skill, which is rare and something I very much enjoy. The only downside and negatives of this game is that servers are often empty, but the core mechanics and gameplay are stellar.  Great pick up even for us modern gamers. It will give you a little taste of history, and what fps use to be like while providing an excellent gaming experiance.",1,0
10,Counter Strike is a great game. Even though it has outdated graphics it still has great gameplay. There are different game modes. 1 is where you have to defuse a bomb or plant a bomb and the other you have to rescue hostages and thats just to name a few. You will definetley enjoy playing this game.,1,0
10,"First at 8 years, since in 2007, A friend comed at my house and installed me a cracked version of Counter - Strike 1.6 . Well I played it like one thousand hours , my friend moved in other country, and when I was playing someone destroyed my CS. I didn't know how to install it again, so i watched on youtube ,I reinstalled it again, That story with the destroy repeats like 2-3 times. I started to be an admin at 10 years, yes 10 years baby, I was doing requests to be an admin and i was telling them i was from 15 to 25 :D Well servers that i was an admin closed , get to the next one , when this closed , to the next one and like that. I always knew that servers close because there is a lot of money to pay to have one. At 12 years i discovered Steam. The first year I did't have any friend on steam because i Haved a ♥♥♥♥ laptop and i was not able to play call of duty 1 on 30 fps. I continued to be an admin on servers. 1 year ago I discovered an server that I love, I have some great owners that are very nice, and some day the owners decided that the admins need to buy Counter-Strike 1.6 . I don't planned to buy Cs 1.6 on steam because i already have it cracked , but i loved the server so much that i buyed it on steam! I think that i have like 5000 hours of play with cracked CS's :)  I totally recommend this game! 11/10  Love CS 1.6! &lt;3",1,0
10,Bought this game (CS anthology bundle) back in 06 from a gaming store in Lamington road and it has been fun playing this every now and then whenever there are good public servers for this game. This game introduced me to STEAM platform as it was a very popular mod of Half-Life. It has been worth every penny to buy this game and I still play it more than I play CSGO.  I get reasonable pings (&lt;50) and I am on MTNL in Mumbai.  If you are newbie lookin to buy I'd recommend you buy the Valve's complete pack during a major sale.,1,0

10," PROS:  + great gameplay + big active community + great choice of weapons + huge amount of mods + lots of community created maps, weapons, AI, soundtracks, etc.   CONS:  - rare issues with graphic cards (especially for laptops) - has replacement in form of newer CS games   Comment:  What is there to introduce? This is a FPS game that most gamers know and the ones that don't should. The laughable half an hour I have displayed here was just testing out the newly bought game. In reality I have played many many many hours with my friends. I played it in high school. I played it in college. I played it with friends after work. While the graphics may be old and this game replaced by its' younger sibblings it still holds out the test of time. While I am no longer able to get my friends together and play this , this game will always be a fond memory for me. And who knows maybe I will pick it up some day again. What I can do is recommend this game to anyone who has not played it or people who are thinking about pruchasing this digital copy. The basic concept of terrorists vs. counter-terrorists is really fun and with the modding community the amount of variation is almost limitless. So grab it if you can, it is very much worth it.",1,0

I remember the early day's of playing and the less than professional LAN parties we arranged in someones house. I can't think of ANYONE in my hometown that did not play this game (BEFORE STEAM even existed) This was the game that brought us all together on weekends, schoolbreaks and we even went as far as moving large CRT monitors just to game. I would like to see the lazy youths of today arrange a LAN where everyone had to carry a large 19inch CRT monitor with them :)  All the drunken insanity of 20youths in a basement-LAN (NO INTERNET!), killing eachother and sharing files on DC++. This was GOOD times or maybe Im just nostalgic about it...  It stole my youth, costed A LOT of keyboards (JÄVLA AWP BÖG?!) and drove our parents insane.

This game is totally worth buying if you like playing in cooperation with friends. 2 team are tying to kill each other with one life. Point is: Terrorists are supposed to destroy a bombsite and Counter Terrorists are supposed to defend it. It works the same in hostage rescue, CT has to take hostages to safety.

10,"Am I really writing a recommendation for this game?  Counter-Strike  or CS 1.6  is a classic game which started off as a Half-Life 1 mod way back in late 1999, and was later sold in 2000 which required both Half-Life 1 and the game itself. Where as now, you only need the game itself on Steam.   Counter-Strike was one of the biggest multiplayer FPS games ever made, due to it being playable on many computers, and just an overall really fun game. It has no doubt made a huge impact on the world of FPS. Especially in the competitive scene such as e-sports where 1.6 is still being played today.  However, it has aged. A lot. Especially in comparison to Counter-Strike: Source. So a lot of maps are quite spacious and don't look as realistic as many would expect to todays standards.   I actually prefer CS:S over this game as I just like the feel of it more.  I honestly don't know why I'm reviewing this game, as I'm sure everyone on my friends list here has played it. But just incase you're that one odd person out that for osme reason hasn't played it - try it out, and see whether you like it or not. ",1,0

I collected alot of great and horrible experience on that game.  Storytime: After learn of the systemmatic of the game. I learned how to shoot. Located the best spots. Choosed the best maps(dust/2, assault..) and rised up to landscape of custom mods as been known the 'heart of Counter-Strike' It begun with Only Knife maps and bringed me up to Surfing, Kreedz.. And after hours and hours of learning. I became extremly skilled.

So i'm bought back to my original question why do so many people,play thos game now, the graphocs look terroble as they would seeing as it was 15 years ago and so on. I would assume becaise it is because of how succesful amd popular the counter strike franchise is. But they mechanics, movement,graphocs and many more wouldn't be good in today's 2015 gaming standards. Do u just play it to try amd revive the good old times or to simply run away from children?",1,0

10,"This will be more of a ''my experience with this game'' type of review, because saying things like ''great gameplay'' will not suit something I've experienced with Counter-Strike. Here you go:  I remember back in 2002 I was at a friend's house and he was playing a game. I didn't know the name of the game nor I had internet to find it. A few weeks passed by and another friend came over and he didn't have a computer, so he brought a disc with a game in it. He told me that it was one of the best games and from that very moment I knew that it is going to be the game I saw at the other friend's house. When I saw the Counter-Strike logo I was filled with gamegasm (?) and I was so happy. I don't remember a day when I was so happy like back then. So, the journey started. I was playing it hardcore. Made friends, clans, was involved in communities and even made two myself. Counter-Strike is my first game which I played competitively and it was a whole experience. Playing public servers and maybe some servers with mods was very fun, but playing it competitively made it very intense and stressful. In a pleasant way, ofcourse.  Shooters these days try to be different, advanced in a way. Sometimes the most simple games like Counter-Strike are the ones that live to this day. Also, there are plenty of mods to keep your attention to this game. The gameplay is very simple - defend as a Counter-Terrorist, attack as a Terrorist to plant the bomb or save the hostages as a CT. I am sure most of you already know this and I doubt there are gamers that haven't heard or know the gameplay of Counter-Strike, so I am sharing here more of my experience.  I wish I could find my CS Anthology account which I've lost since 2008. So, I decided I am going to buy this game again and here you go - more than a thousand hours played. I still play it from time to time to this day and it brings back many great memories and I sometimes even stumble upon people I've played with years ago. I think Counter-Strike changed gaming in a major way and we wouldn't have many games like we have today, if this game wouldn't exist.   I am sure many of people already have played games like CS:GO, but never the roots. I doubt any of you will play it for more than an hour, because it's much more simple and it differs a lot in my opinion from CS:GO and modern games.",1,0

10,"Never before has a multiplayer game blended all the elements of true competition and sweat-soaked-shirt anxiety as well a Counter-Strike (CS). You probably already know CS as one of the most popular modifications for Half-Life. It's been available for download for over a year, at least in beta form. But unless you've got a super fast Internet connection at your house, you may not have played it yet as the nearly 100 megabyte download may be daunting for those of you not fortunate enough to have a high-speed connection. Thankfully CS has turned into a full-blown retail game and, while the two versions of CS are identical, it certainly worth shelling out $10 for this stellar title...plus you get a few more multiplayer goodies in the retail package to boot.  Let me start off by saying that the Counter-Strike pack is a stand-alone product. You don't need the original Half-Life to play this game. In the retail package you get a full version of CS as well as Team Fortress Classic, Opposing Force multiplayer, and the Wanted, Redemption and Firearms mods. The entire pack is overflowing with multiplayer fun, but, of course, the real focus of the retail release is Counter-Strike.  There is a single-player component to CS and, while it provides a good primer, this mod is all about online action. You basically play a game of cat and mouse, with the mouse being a terrorist group and the cat a squad of counter-terrorists. As a terrorist, you're goal is to plant a bomb at a specific location or hold a group of hostages. As a counter-terrorist, it's your duty to defuse said bomb or rescue the ill-fated hostages. Taking out all players on the opposing side will also assure your victory.  CS is an action lover's dream, with games lasting only four or five minutes (if that in some cases) because, unlike Half-Life, one shot to the head can mean instant death. CS is the perfect mix between fast-action and realistic damage. You can't just absorb bullet after bullet and expect to walk away. Working as a team is a must and, while you're in the game, taking the lone wolf approach will often get you killed...and fast.  It's the team-based tactics that make CS so fun. I can't stress how important it is in this game to act as a team. If your team is on the defensive side you'll all benefit by creating a cohesive strategy. If you team is on the offensive side, you will all benefit by sticking closely together as well. I'm sure you've seen movies or television show demonstrating this 'Conga Line' style of infiltration. Well, that's exactly how your team will have to act. This creates a fantastic game balance that will keep you coming back for more. It'll also keep you from thinking about your school work, your job, and interaction with your loved ones, and often work around the IGN offices will be put on hold so we can clog our network with CS.  Visually the game will not disappoint. While the Half-Life engine isn't the prettiest beast out there, there is plenty of animation that creates a smooth look and feel, and the gun models are some of the most realistic looking of any shooter available. The environmental textures look realistic enough and complement the provided camouflage well enough for you to be hidden, but not be invisible. As in real life, the distinguishable difference between good guy and bad guy is a little difficult, but the balance to this is if you can't tell who it is then you probably won't be able to hit him with your gun. Now, if you've purchased sniper rifle, you should have plenty of scope magnification to tell the difference between terrorist or counter-terrorist, but otherwise you may be taking out a team member from afar.  As good as it is, a couple of features of this game really stood out as frustrating... at first. But over a period of time they actually became enhancements to online multiplayer gaming. One feature is buying your weapons at the start of each round. This takes a little getting used to at first since, in most shooters, you just run around picking up weapons at your heart's content. Usually by the time you figured out which guns, grenades, and armor you were going to take in your early games, the bad guys would come over and kill you. But a couple of tries later, after getting the gist of things, you're off in no time. The other feature that took some getting used to was the 'wait and watch' feature after you get killed. Once you sustain a lethal injury, you have to wait for the next round to start before you can join in again -- you don't just spawn again and start shooting. This actually adds a ton of anxiety to your efforts of staying alive and completing your objective. But like I mentioned before, the rounds are short, so you shouldn't have to wait too long before you can jump in the action again.  Not surprisingly, the user interface is very Half-Life-esque. Gamers who have played Half-Life or any of the other mods for the game will have no trouble with the menu system. Even for the first time user the interface is easy to use or fumble through. The only thing that even slightly tripped us up in the interface is the 'Update' on the server page. First-time users may be confused into thinking this meant update my version of CS. Not true, it actually means update the list of game servers. But the rest of the interface is easy to understand and even easier to navigate.  Just about the only aspect of this game that we could make negative comments about is the sound. Sure, the realistic guns sounds are spot on, we just wish the same amount of attention to detail was given to the rest of the sound in the game. Some levels have lighting and thunder. When the thunder crashes it sounds a little wimpy. We were hoping for some deeper bass and clearer sounding claps from the lightning. In most of the level the user can go inside or out side of buildings, the sound of their footsteps should also change to reflect what type of surface they are walking on. The sound of footsteps getting closer and closer could also have been improved. As it stands now, it's hard to tell how far down the hallway or street a bad guy is from you by sound alone.  So how long does the magic last? Well we've been playing this game for over a year now and we still can't get enough of it. Are we tired of it? Hell no! We're still surprised by how fun this game is. This game actually made some of us squeal like little school-girls after getting sniped from an unexpected angle on high. On the other hand some of us were drawn to stand up and scream obscenities at the monitor. I guess we'll just have to get them next time!  In a nutshell, if you're looking for the next step in online first person shooters, then look no further. CS is fast paced, intense, and satisfying--this game will not disappoint. This is truly one of the best mods for one of the all time greatest first person shooters ever, and the retail package of CS is simply bursting with multiplayer goodness. If you like to play shooters online, get this pack!",1,0

While the Counter-Terrorist's objective is to Stop the bomb from being planted, If it is planted, They have to eliminate all Terrorist and Defuse the bomb.

Runs smoothly on 53 FPS, woow sounds are great, look an AK-47 but name CV-47 you play it you shoot, you get killed asking yourself how you didn't kill him cause you shot 27 bullets on that guy and he still is alive. You play it over and over, finally getting your first kill. (cause the enemy was coruching and looking the other way and you instantly kill him running 17 bullets spent) you get high hopes, I can play this game it is so easy. You get more kills, you get greedy you rush alone you get killed when you even thought about rushing by an AWP on mid. Ages pass, poeple pass, kills get comon. You start to play better, after 2 years you learn the recoils you learn the hidding spots, you know what is the enemy's next move. You practise your awp then. You play DM and DM only with an awp, your kills are slick, and your flicks are quick and accurate. Admin invites you to his clan. FIrst time you play this game with somenone for serious. You can't do anything cause you are not used to an opposite player to play smartly and you get owned, you don't do kills and your teammates question your skill. Couple more months pass you learn your duties as a teammate. You give info you cover you open. Clan gets closed down, you find another clan you are one of the best players. You play more switch clans for better ones. You get to LANs you get scared of the all expecations and so many eyes on you. You tilt and miss your shots, months pass, you get better, you become a man of steel and high nervous, 2000 hours pass you are finally a great player. 10 000 hours pass, you win LANs you play against better players, you try a gainst payed players you are toe-to-toe with them but you loose cause your team isn't on that level and they get scared. 20 000 hours pass game is dying and so is your love for this game. But no one can pay thoose voice chats from 8 P.M till 6 A.M every weekend with your friends. So much hours in this game and you acomplished nothing. You play against your local teams you get banned cause they don't expect somene to play that good without cheats and you stop playing this cause cheaters take over, very 12 year old first downloads a cheat then this game. You get mentally tortured cause the kid is telling you how bad you are and that you suck, you cry inside. Thinking what happened to me, how come this kid plays better then me, then you figure out the cheats are great, but you still play it fairly. You cry cause no one cares for e-sports in your country and no one wants to pay you for playing games. Your parents tell you you don't have a life you loose some friends, you loose your girlfriend you stop being active in sports. YOu just play this game hoping to be recognised, but you don't so to help everyone in this world after 30 000 hours on this game, don't play it it is a sinking ship and it is pulling you down. Tears are in my eyes for all the time I was good but now you can't play a normal match since cheaters will destory you... run READER, move away, press back and never turn back on this game..",-1,1

10," Counter-Strike, in all of its versions, is just a great FPS game that anyone can enjoy. It's a great game and all, you just can't stop playing it, you can just sit and play with your friends for days without stopping from doing it. The huge weaponry options, which you can choose, the smoothness of the gameplay and sound of the game, it's just really addicting. With this game, I've met so many different people and unique friends. This game is literally G(OLD). I recommend this masterpiece to all the passionate Action &amp; F.P.S. players who are looking for a good, cheap and fun game to play with their friends.

10,"Counter-Cstrike 1.6 is one of the best FPS games. You can do almost anything in it, which is pretty awesome, at least for me, when the player can modify things to his/her liking. You can choose from many modes, ex. Knife, Awp, Aim, Deathmatch, Surf, KreedZ, Zombie, CoD MW2, W3 FT and so on. You can change models/skins, try almost anything if not everything. It is a shame that so many people did not see its potential, but ofcourse, the time goes on &amp; the era changes, but no matter what, Counter-Cstrike 1.6 will always be my n1 OldSql game. Frankly speaking, I reccommend to try out this game to any FPS game lover, because I think he/she will not regret it.

We'd make jokes back and forth with the radio but when I started asking for nude ♥♥♥ pics (no homo), the dude didn't respond ;_; . Two hours later, I noticed a player wouldn't stop trying to jump on a single ledge. Failing, he would back up and then try again and again and again without end and never shot back. I just sat there are watched him. That was when I realized the entire server was just bots and my conversations were with the rare amount of human players. Didn't know what to think. ",1,0

10,"Counter-Strike makes you work to enjoy the content, and you'll have to put many hours of play into it before enjoying the feeling of conquering it.  Weapons are a huge part of the series too, with CS:GO not an exception. Each round provides a cash sum based on your previous performance, and with this you can purchase armour, projectiles and weapons. Firearms range from standard assault rifles to shotguns and sniper rifles, and you'll want to experiment with each one to see which works best.  What makes Counter-Strike such a popular series - and what will no doubt make CS:GO the next big PC shooter - is the thrill of the ego chase. As you die, often continuously, the frustration is outweighed by an aspiration to do better. In a game where success is pinned on attention to detail, death often triggers an internal failure analysis that the player will mull over while waiting for a new session to load. It becomes a spiral of egging yourself on to do better - and if you become a good player, the game becomes a stage for you to parade your skills.  Global Offensive builds on the CS series by going through a significant checklist presented by its community and marking off as many points as possible. Gun game as its own separate mode? Check. Competitive capabilities built in? Check. Map balancing here and there? Check, check, check.  As a result, there are numerous upgrades that will adjust gameplay while also making accessibility far better. The wide range of grenades, for example, will likely make play more tactical - laying down incendiary grenades will thwart rushes, while decoys, which fake gunfire and fool radar points, are brilliant tools for messing with the minds of established players.  The actual core shooting will be a huge talking point for many months to come. It has been tinkered slightly and gives weapons a noticeably floaty feel, which doesn't sit well to begin with. We eventually found ourselves enamoured by it, and the impact of hits add a real tactile distinction to play.  It's what doesn't work, however, that is most notable. Regular mode has no new maps added to it, while all the new guns seem somewhat cosmetic. Global Offensive has also removed some of its middling weapons such as the MP5, essentially pushing even more players to stick with the AK and the M4. Sometimes it gives the impression that there is in fact less valuable content than in previous CS releases.  If one assumed this was Counter-Strike Source with a visual mod installed, there would often be little to shake that impression.  There's also now a split between casual and competitive servers - however, many players aren't yet aware of the differences, mainly because the distinction isn't made obvious enough. It becomes even more confusing if you join a community server with all hosts of mods installed on it, which have perhaps taken casual mode, turned friendly fire on and essentially made it as close to Source as possible.  At times, arranging games in Competitive Mode feels like a chore. Joining a five-on-five war is simple enough, but attempt to lobby up with a group of friends and join a game, and you'll often hit a snag. Myself and a few others tried to find a competitive game with no luck, simply being told that no servers were currently available.  When you finally do join, it works fine, but the wait and work required to find a game seems like a drawback. We eventually gave up and resorted to using IRC to find matches, as we would with Source.  Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is not the key evolution point that we were hoping for, and the response from the community often reflects this view. On many occasions, other players used phrases such as 'same old' to us.  This is elementally Counter-Strike Source with some fine-tuning under the bonnet, and Valve appears to have acknowledged this with the reasonable RRP attached to it.  And yet the core DNA of the game has not lost its appeal. This is still a glorious experience that sets a benchmark for all multiplayer shooters. Valve's objective with Global Offensive was to draw together the active communities of both the Source and trusty 1.6 edition. It clearly has a good chance.",1,0

10,"A great game of cat-and-mouse where you either play as a terrorist (plant bombs or hold hostages) or counter-terrorist (defend bombsites or rescue hostages). Either complete those objectives or kill all players of the opposing team to win the round.  Counter-Strike is a fast-paced, realistic shooter that encourages teamwork so play with a friend (it's also more fun). The graphics hasn't aged well but the guns still looks authentic. One thing I hate about Counter-Strike is when you die, you have to sit and wait until the round ends. Even if the rounds are usually short, it's frustrating and it puts a ton of anxiety to your efforts of staying alive. Fortunately, Counter-Strike has tons of mods available so you're able to play the game in many different ways. This helps the game from becoming monotonous and keep the game fresh.  There's also not a lot of detail in the sound, other than the guns, but that's a minor complaint. The mods, dedicated servers and competitive nature of the game is what holds this game together to this day and that's why millions of people still play this old-school game. Although there are many better shooters on the market now, Counter-Strike's unique gameplay is what keeps me coming back from time to time.  8/10 - GREAT GAME",1,0

I couldn't find a lobby that wasn't full except for one lobby with only a single guy playing with bots in a TDM game. Now this guy was either really good at CS or hacking but i've never gone 15+ deaths 0 kills by the same guy. Another interesting thing to note is how the maps are vastly different from their counterparts in CSGO which isn't a bad thing just interesting. Secondly, there is a lot less spread in the guns than there is in CSGO a long with a different types of weapons...well for most the only difference was the name of the gun. Also there were more options for CT and T teams. Interesting to play probably won't play again but hey i need it for GMOD reasons.",1,0

10,"Made by Valve Software in 2000, originaly a mod for Half-Life in 1999. The most recently update is known as version 1.6. This game isn't balanced: the Desert Eagle is TO overpowered, USP too, rest of the pistols are mostly useless. The SMGs are quite good, but not as good as the Assault RIfles thoe. If you play this game right now, then expect little kids, russians, or just some wierd guys, who somehow see trough walls and always kill you with a one shot in the head... But renember: this game is amazing, alot of nostalgia for it. I would recomend to buy Counter Strike: Global Offensive, because it is more balanced, better movement, actual physics, and renember: you CAN earn money!!

10,"Despite my hilariously low count of, 0.6 hours, on record, I can attest to you that, nay, I have played this game(and it's 'sequels') to the ends of time. I've literally sunk close to 15,000 hours into the various derivations of CS over the years.  I found out about CS from some #IRC chat I used to frequent back in the day(it might have been an ICQ chat with one of them). Namely, I started with the first ALPHA(yea, not beta, ALPHA). I can recall the loading screen and everything. From there, I progressed through the initial betas, introduction of maps, and various weapons(anyone remember the OLD cs_siege, complete with working apc and sniper tower?), etc.  I then became a player in various 'leagues'; I won't name drop, but I was a baller at one time.  So, yes, this game is good. Some people recommend CSGO as the 'modern' return of 1.6, but I disagree. CSGO is better than CSS, yes, but still not on-par with 1.6, nothing will ever be :(  Goodbye WON-servers.",1,0

10,"This insightful and damning critique of the military-industrial complex deserves to be highlighted for its trenchant social commentary as much as for its streamlined, highly polished gameplay. This is a multiplayer shooter with two teams, 'terrorists' and 'counter-terrorists,' but tellingly the player shuffles between the two with ease and there are basically no differences between being on one side or the other, save for their objective, which is often to plant a bomb on nothing of value or rescue 'hostages' who disappear immediately when rescued, as if they were created solely to sustain the conflict. Both teams purchase their weapons from the same supplier with money they earn from fighting each other: endless soldiers fighting an eternal war driven not by ideology but by the military industrial complex, where fighting simply leads to more money and more fighting rather than an eventual peaceful resolution. The graphics could use some work. 8/10!",1,0

10,"At first a third-party mod for Half-Life Deathmatch, Counter Strike became one of the most recognized and accoladed FPS's amongst the PC gaming community, and 1.6 is still going strong with hundreds of servers available free-to-play worldwide, even after the release of Source (the newer version of CS using the HL2 engine).   Nothing comes close to the intuitive physics and control provided by the old-school Half-Life 1 engine. Clever map design, in combination with a wide (but not overly-acclectic) collection of firearms and equipment at your disposal make for exciting deathmatch-style firefights as well as situtions requiring strategy and coordination with teamates.   The beauty of this game is it's simplicity, and diversity of action: There are no classes, no upgrades or bonuses, and nothing giving any player any sort of in-game advantage over another, save for skill and knowledge of the game. A large arsenal of uniquely-tuned weapons, CS's worldwide appeal and player base, and a plethora of every map type you could possibly imagine make for some very memorable gameplay experiences.",1,0

Weapons has hard recoil so you can't just spray and pray, short burst fire can save you in critical situation. Before the round begins, you can and need to buy weapons and equipments with money, you get money by winning the round or killing the enemy team. This type of gameplay encourages team work.    [The legendary FPS, till this day its still being played quite actively, 'old but gold' is the only thing that applies here. You either win by teaming up or you'll be clutching the rounds, the game that'll take some time to become good at and will never feel like you've wasted your time as you can always continue learning and becoming better.]",1,0

10,"Counter-Strike (officially abbreviated as CS) is a series of multiplayer first-person shooter video games, in which teams of terrorists and counter-terrorists battle to, respectively, perpetrate an act of terror (bombing, hostage-taking) and prevent it (bomb defusal, hostage rescue). The series began on Windows in 1999 with the first version of Counter-Strike. It was initially released as a modification for Half-Life and designed by Minh 'Gooseman' Le and Jess 'Cliffe' Cliffe, before the rights to the game's intellectual property were acquired by Valve Corporation, the developers of Half-Life.  The game was followed-up with Counter-Strike: Condition Zero, developed by Turtle Rock Studios and released in 2004. Later that same year, Counter-Strike: Source was released by Valve. Released only eight months after Counter-Strike: Condition Zero, in November 2004, the game was a remake of the original Counter-Strike and the first in the series to run on Valve's newly created Source engine.[1] The fourth game in the main series to have been developed by Valve, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, was released in 2012 for Windows, OS X, Xbox 360, and PlayStation 3. Hidden Path Entertainment, who also worked on Counter-Strike: Source post-release, helped to develop the game alongside Valve.[2] Several spin-off titles have been released for Asian territories.",1,0

Don't get me wrong, I love games from this era like Quake, HL1 and I still enjoy those more than newer entries, but I just can't see why you would buy this when CS:GO is miles better for a tiny increase in price.

Counter-Strike pits a team of counter-terrorists against a team of terrorists in a series of rounds. Each round is won by either completing the mission objective or eliminating the opposing force. The game has both individual and multiplayer options. Bots can be added into the game. The online-multiplayer option is activated via Steam.  Other than similarities in basic gameplay, Counter-Strike is not in any way related to Half-Life.

10,"Hello people, i would like to spread the world about this game. Graphics kinda bad, but its about the action, eh? So, it is mainly based as a game, terrorists vs counter-terrorists. Terrorists have to plant the bomb,(at de_maps) or secure the hostages (at cs_maps). Counter ones needs to do the opposite, defuse or deny the bomb (at de_maps) and get the hostages back (at cs_maps). There are a lot of mods, if you dont like the classic mode. But i really think that everyone knows about this game :).  P.s. Im doing this for a steam badge :D",1,0

For example when I was 7, installing the cracked version of that game and then just shooting anyone who gets in my way without controlling the recoil. (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻ and lol traded this game for some crappy AK-47 in CS GO. Huehuehuehuehue. I give it 8/8 m8. pls liek no hate no homo tenks. Oh and btw the funniest thing about this game is brining your CS GO skills there, doing 1 hit kills and then getting banned from servers for 'hacking' Like I've joined a sever once, done 7 headshots in a row without dying, then some speccy ♥♥♥♥ is sayin': 'wh and aim off or im banning you.'

10,"The origin of addiction... One of the most fun games I've had the pleasure of enjoying and the one who threw me to the vibrant world of FPS, my favorite genre 'til this day. Now, important information: do not be fooled by the amount of hours marked by Steam. There, when the beta versions were launched in 1999, when the game was free. Then 1.6 was launched until about 4 years ago, I had it in a different account, which I do not own anymore. Over a decade of gaming, several hours every day, which certainly have accumulated thousands of hours. By far the most played game throughout my life... You see, the first sentence that illustrates this review was not chosen at random. I had to stop playing completely, cold turkey, or I would fail high school. Just decided to buy it again and play for nostalgia sake. I'm not afraid, I'm much more self controlled now and the fact that I'm not even half as good as before, kinda takes away the compulsion to play. By far the longest relationship I have ever had and we are getting back together... this is a good day.",1,0

10,"Counter-Strike is a first-person shooter game in which players join either the terrorist team, the counter-terrorist team, or become spectators. Each team attempts to complete their mission objective and/or eliminate the opposing team. Each round starts with the two teams spawning simultaneously.  The objectives vary depending on the type of map, and these are the most usual ones:  Bomb defusal: The terrorists must carry a bomb, plant it on one of the designated spots and protect it from being disarmed by the counter-terrorists before it explodes to win. The counter-terrorists win if the time runs out with no conclusion. Hostage rescue: The counter-terrorists must rescue a group of hostages held by the terrorists to win. The terrorists win if the time runs out with no conclusion. VIP escort: One of the counter-terrorists is chosen to act as a VIP and the team must escort this player to a designated spot on the map to win the game. The terrorists win if the VIP is killed or if the time runs out with no conclusion. A player can choose to play as one of eight different default character models (four for each side, although Counter-Strike: Condition Zero added two extra models, bringing the total to ten). Players are generally given a few seconds before the round begins (known as 'freeze time') to prepare and buy equipment, during which they cannot attack or move. They can return to the buy area within a set amount of time to buy more equipment (some custom maps included neutral 'buy zones' that could be used by both teams). Once the round has ended, surviving players retain their equipment for use in the next round; players who were killed begin the next round with the basic default starting equipment.  Standard monetary bonuses are awarded for winning a round, losing a round, killing an enemy, being the first to instruct a hostage to follow, rescuing a hostage, planting the bomb (Terrorist) or defusing the bomb (Counter-Terrorist).  The scoreboard displays team scores in addition to statistics for each player: name, kills, deaths, and ping (in milliseconds). The scoreboard also indicates whether a player is dead, carrying the bomb (on bomb maps), or is the VIP (on assassination maps), although information on players on the opposing team is hidden from a player until his/her death, as this information can be important.  Killed players become 'spectators' for the duration of the round; they cannot change their names before their next spawn, text chat cannot be sent to or received from live players, and voice chat can only be received from live players and not sent to them. Spectators are generally able to watch the rest of the round from multiple selectable views, although some servers disable some of these views to prevent dead players from relaying information about living players to their teammates through alternative media (most notably voice in the case of Internet cafes and Voice over IP programs such as TeamSpeak or Ventrilo). This form of cheating is known as 'ghosting.'",1,0

10,"For those who, put negative reviews, well not for those but for all of them, you write negative review just because game lags, it's only your problem, much of the people has no problems with this game, this game can be ran easily on potato pc, same if you got a VAC ban that's your problem, that's your problem if you're stupid and can't play legitimately, many cheaters in your opinion?? Find another server don't sit on one server, or go to Steam-only server. People play this game only for fun, there are no ranks(not talking about server's specific ranks), that's the most important thing. Of course teamgame on this mostly dissapeared, people play only by theirselves, but that's good, you know why? You will never get nervous if your teammate fails to defuse the bomb or something like that, because you play by yourself. Talking about game modes, oh God there are so much modes, starting from Surf ending with Zombie Plague. You can play this with your friends easily, cause there are no rank restrictions. The ban system and other things like amx_ban or amx_kick are highly fixed and upgraded at maximum. You can put whatever skins you want from CS:GO and so on, and use it without any restrictions. This old - school game is being massively played for 16 years now and i think that after 10 years he's going to be played still.  Highly recommended!",1,0

10,"Ok, I admit, I played this game back in my childhood on my original Xbox, and had so much fun. Not too long ago I reinstalled it for my computer, but when I did, I HATED it. I couldn't play right. People would one tap me from the side of the map, others will just be an absolute pro with the AWP making life so hard. Theres no mercy for new players, there's no official Valve servers, only the community servers which take away the classic feel. I have probably only joined 2 servers that have none of the stupid annoying Quake sounds. No 'double kill' or 'dominating' just classic CS 1.6. It was aggrovating for me, my favourite childhood game gone to waste, or so I thought. I was just bad at the game. I was scared to do anything. If I pushed in first, I thought I would get destroyed immediately. The guns felt weird and ridiculously inaccurate, the game didn't FEEL right, and anything I tried would ultimately fail. Well, until a couple of weeks ago.   I played violent. I played smart. I played gruesome and unforgiving. Getting 4 man spray downs and one-double tap headshots across the map. I was ruthless, relentless, and I enjoyed it. This game was starting to be fun for me, not as annoying, not as frustrating, only fun, as I always wanted it to be. The thing is I learned not to be scared, the same with CSGO. I played CSGO, sucked at it, played horribly until I just began to not care if I died. That was when I began to play better. CS 1.6 came, and I began to be horrifying. Enemy teams would scream at me, I would laugh and continue, their unfornate moments was fuel to my wrath, until, of course as it always happens, a pro AWPer comes towards me and 420 swagscopes me in the face. Rage quit.  11/10 would get Blazed it again.",1,0

10,"The games dead. Its basically worthless to anyone in USA unless you want to play with third worlders. Even then theres only a few servers it looks like. I would rather die than play with South Americans. Anything south of the US border is just hell ( I have never had a positive experience online with these people and if you know anything about geopolitics I need not go into that), so I advise not dealing with these peoples idiocy and just going with CSGO these days unless you want to LAN this game.  One of the greatest FPS games to ever come out and will forever remain a classic but also a game that can still compete design and gameplay wise with games released in more current times. We will never have the natural form of support from players and ESPORTS ever again. This is before ESports was just a way for devs to market and shill a game. This was from when people who liked to play a game competed and not just a bunch of rich kids trying to win monetary prizes like ESports is now (who else could play CSGO all day erry day in this economy?)  People got behind this game because they liked it, instead CSGO is all about market manipulation and human psychology manipulating with less consideration about gameplay because they want the most monetary return. If the idiots will pay hundreds for a digital knife skin then why would any company invest in gameplay that won't have direct returns like a digital nongood would have?  The video game market is full of idiots who will dump money into anything now just so they can distract themselves from the politcs, economics, and slowly declining living conditions of the western world. Bread and circus in its truest form.  CS 1.6 is from better days, more honest days. When people who wanted to make games, and people who wanted to play games were very closely related and the average IQ of someone who was online was higher than now. These days every idiot has an internet connection. That is to say, the target audience then was just better than the target audiences of todays games. This is exampled many times in economics.

It is often described as being 'a show about nothing', as many of its episodes are about the minutiae of daily life. ",1,0

10,"DON'T FALL FOR NOSTALGIA BIAS  Pros: -classic feel  -people still play it(barely) -no skins(almost)  Cons: -80% of the players are hackers and do not speak english(so no real teamwork) -real servers with the gamemode actually being a CS type are almost non-existant -actual enjoyability comes from whether or not you like to deal with the above  This is one of gamings most treasered games and it is sad to see it get like this. Nostalgia can only get people so far and it is a shame thaat few people explain the reality of this game in their reviews. The fun is not totally gone, although it is something you have to really try to find. The gameplay is as you would expect it (at least when you find a server that doesn't have CSGO surfers on it), nothing has changed and thats good. The problem is the community. It is hard to find a server with a team you can communicate with because of the major language barrier the game now has.  Communication is key in this game as you would expect, and it is very rare because almost everytime you get on a server it is from a central american area and the players mostly speak spanish. Making it difficult as you would expect.   The amount of hacking in this game shameful, it is more common than it is in CSGO and is a real problem that makes the experience more bad than it already has become.  The server types are just like what you would see in an old game, modded to hell with new terribly unenjoyable game modes. If you were to see you would find many gameplay modded servers that give you trash that nobody wants to see (surfing).   Take away the nostalgia bias that everyone tosses out and you will see that this game is a former shell of itself. It has all the elements of a typical old PC game that only a few people will try hard enough to enjoy. The enjoyment can still be found, but at a heavy heavy cost. RIP CS1.",-1,1

Maybe the first things i saw was just an error.. but founding a folder that was insulting me? I dont think so Valve, i can report this '''''error'''' but i didn't.  I buy this game just for enjoy my old times.. So i prefer download it pirate.  PS: I never touch any file or change something. Again, idk how Valve can do this and i don't think was a 'hacker'.

10,"Horrible, just horrible. Everyone gives this good reviews based on nostalgia. I saw all the good reviews and thought I should try it out. Upon opening the game, was a cringy menu. I fiddle with the settings, and theres no damn graphics options! I put the crosshair on small.(Definitely not small) So, I go to servers and all the servers have horrible maps. Plus, closest servers had 0 players. I click on a Dust 2 server with 10 players. When it loads up, nobody speaks ♥♥♥♥ing english. The buy menu controls were so ♥♥♥♥ed up I couldnt buy a gun. So, I stuck with the pistol. I go through the middle, and all the players look the same! You cant even tell who's who. Literally, the ♥♥♥♥ing same. So I die instantly because i couldn't even tell it was an enemy. ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. I finally managed to buy a gun in the ♥♥♥♥ed up menu. I find someone, spray at em', and surprisingly it was enemy. My gun starts shooting in the ♥♥♥♥ing sky, recoil over 9000, and I was burst firing! Absolute ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. Another HORRIBLE thing about this game, its graphics and audio! It just doesnt meet todays standards. I think I might have to bleach my eyes after glancing at this game. Its horrible. I only played the game for under 10 minutes and I already want to kill my self. Trust me, save your money. If you loved this game as a kid, I dont care get it. But if youre looking for a good FPS, to TODAYS standards, dont get this garbarge! Save your ten dollars and use it to get your ♥♥♥♥ sucked by the girl down the street. So, simplest way possible.

10,First please read the review because there are a lot of fanboys who downvote all negative ones just because you want me to think perfectly of this game!  Well first of all i wanna say i dont have much to say other than this game is amazing i have played it my entire life but not the steam version a pirated version and please dont hate me for that but the most stable version of this game is pirate version wanna know the reasons why? ok fine here they are: 1.CL_flushentitypacket error which is extremely annoying given the fact that it will lagg you out and it cant be fixed because most of the servers are against the fix and usually that fix doesnt even work. While that error occurs on pirated version too it occurs really rarely while on steam version it doesnt stop the whole damn game and it is either the server that will kick you for using that fix or VAC that will kick you if you are lucky and ban you and you arent even using the third party software!!! its a console FLIPPING COMMAND!!! 2.There are a ton of servers that have a virus that will rebind all of your keys to join their server once you join the server for the first time and honestly i dont know how will this benefit either the owner of the server or you because you cant even play the server normally you will just reconnect all over again when you try to do something and in all honesty if you do such thing on your server ♥♥♥♥ you and i hope you get cancer. But you might be thinking how is this connected to not buying this game? well simple and i have 2 reasons for that. First reason is that why do you want to spend money on a game that has this type of issue and second of all the reason why this is a biggie is that in pirated version of the game you can change your binds and it will all save but unlike the steam version the 'Synchronizing feature' will save stuff but if you change the binds it will come back because people who use this exploit can work their way around it and trust me you will encounter a lot of servers like that. But trust me i dont hate this game in fact this is the game that got me into pc gaming back in 2004 but is it worth it buying a game that doesnt benefit you in any way as a legal version? of course not but its not me thinking that this game is ♥♥♥♥ in fact its evolutionary its perfect and i have spent 1000+ hours outside of steam version and i gotta say i have been getting a lot less errors and a lot less ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t messages from vac for me trying to fix this error and a lot less problems than i had with the LEGAL VERSION THAT SHOULD BE MORE OF A QUALITY THAN THE ILLEGAL VERSION!. And im not promoting piracy in fact i think its lame but this is the game that should be pirated because it doesnt offer anything good in legal version in fact it downgrades a lot but when there are 50000 people that are hidden off your charts of cs 1.6 just because they wanna play normally and pirate the game there is something seriously wrong with the legal version and i really dont recommend buying this its the same as the pirated version but with more game breaking stuff! ,-1,1

10,"Counter-strike, my childhood! Brings bad memories back...  One of the first Valve games, and this one is a total ♥♥♥♥. I understand why Half-life sucks so much, but how famous multiplayer trash shooter can be so badly made?! There is two teams, terrorist team and counter-terrorist team (both acts like scumbags). Your goal is to kill other team or place the bomb as terrorist. Allahu akbar! Never seen this before, bad guys can actually win. Its terrorism propaganda! Counter-strike playerbase is worst part of this, they dumb as ♥♥♥♥ and hot headed of course, alot of cheaters who cant play fair, this makes this game completely unplayable and innocent people get VAC ban (like me). Valve dont want to take responsibilty, they want to have fun with their ♥♥♥♥ing Steam money and spit on us! There is only one official game mode, kill each other and take score. Pfff, we need more!

I highly suggest one passes by this out of date game, as classic as it may be. I compare an exaggeration of the experience for a new player to that of being anally entered, spontaneously, by barbed nethers. Overwhelming, painful, and a strong sense of defenselessness.

10,"Counter-Strike, this one also known as Counter-Strike 1.6, is a team-based multiplayer realistical/military shooter. And a very well known one at that. It was first available as a free mod for Half-Life 1, being patched regulary up to version 1.6, until recently it got it's way onto Steam, as a serapately sold title.  So, how is the player base? Counter-strike 1.6, being popular self, has an active player base. You will see many servers, up to 32 players. At very least there are many Russian servers, as it had a cult following over there, can't really see past them. On bad side, most seems to prefer 'Terrorist plant C4' mode and then De_Dust2 is the most played map. A lot of servers run small mods, that may alter balance or other small things. And most of it, playerbase had a lot of time to play and master this game, so new players will be more frustated than having fun learning.  Counter-Strike is a very well known realistical FPS. It gained it's popularity while being free mod for popular Half-Life, because it provided something else what wasn't overused yet - realistical shootouts (using models of real weapons, you know) in team multiplayer. Unforgiving and furious. Or unbalanced and twitchy one-shot kills with headshots. Whichever one you prefer.   Counter-Strike has two types of map. First, 'de', is a mode where counter-terrorists have do defends few market spots on map from terrorist. One of the terrorists spawns with C4 in inventrory and has to bring it to one of the marked spots to plant it adn start to countdown of T's victory. Roles change as Terrorists will have now to defend this place from CTs, who's aim now are to defuse the bomb, in which case CTs will win the round, no matter how many more Ts are left. Pretty interesting mode and most played, otherwise this game would have been camping fest. And if one site is too well defended, Ts can go to another one. And then there is a second type, 'cs', in which CTs have to to rescue hostages by bringing them back to base. The problem there, is that hostage NPCs aren't perfect (though good enough) and since CTs have to rescue them all, Terrorist can camp in one of the spots around them, since CTs will have no choice but to come to win. Much less played and even if it does, it goes like your everyday Team Deathmatch, just killing all of opposite team. Much simpler anyway.  Now, the core gameplay... There are few rounds. Each round starts with each team spawning on their side of map. There is no respawning during round, once person is dead he is out, so you will have to worry much more about getting insta-killed. There are no items placed on map itself either (on correct, official maps), no kind of medikits. In spawn place, you have 15 seconds to press 'b' button (or whichever you set) to bring up 'buy menu', where you purchase weapons and equipment for the round witht he money that you earned so far. Yep, when round ends everybody gets some sum of money to spend, with winning team getting more, an ingenius design decision that helps losing team to get steamrolled even harder. What you can buy there is a pistol, primary weapon and any of the equipment. (Yep, if it doesn't smell like prototype of modern military shooters) Once past purchase screen, you are free to run and shoot. And here comes the art of recoil and aiming. For you see, one of the more important thing that is used in this game is accuaricy of your weapon. If you move it drops. if you jump, it drops. It drops while you are shooting too. Thus it becomes more importanly to get good position, making assaults more compilated, and you often have to relearn to shoot, making few clicks instead of just holding down mouse button. You will have to be often walking instead of running, to keep accuaricy while moving (it also makes you silent, so do it often), or just stand and crouch sometimes. Burst shooting is better there and for long range targets you want to be just click few times. Another important thing is that you can shoot through some walls with more powerful primary weapons. So don't be surprised for people shooting through door, walls and even just over the corner, it indeed does small damage to whoever is behind. The game also emphasises aiming because it supports headshots and they do a MASSIVE damage. And you also got three kinds of grenades. Explosive (HE), which explodes, good for throwing into chokepoints. Flashbang, which blinds whoever looked at it when it blows for few seconds, quite annoying but good for stroming into room. And Smoke Grenade, when you don't want enemies to see you coming and don't want to be under direct fire, good for open spaces with snipers (who instakill you when you peek around corner). Protip: You run slightly faster with knife out.  And well, while on theory it sounds interesting, as well as empashises teamwork. here comes the downfall of the game. The weapons, while make people with gun fetish happy, are badly balanced around each other. There are just best and bad weapons. From pistols Desert Eagle is the best, they behave as backup when you got no time to reload primary weapon. Shotguns are theorically good for close range but in this game they are useless and Assault Rifles can kill even better at close range. Sub-Machine Guns category had advantage of no accuaricy drops while moving, but are still inferior to Rifles. Rifles category has two best guns: all-range assault rifle like AK-47 and all-range sniper rifle like AWP (which doesn't even require headshot to one-hit kill), exactly what majority of people use. The only Machine Gun is 'pew pew pew can't hit'. And all-range is all-range, random is random. You may run and shoot in general direction of enemy and pull off a headshot from your AK-47 by luck. Or you may walk around corner, thinking of your next grandious tactical plan, just to get headshotted in insta-second by guy with sniper rifle from close range. It's just so full of cheap and frustating, the rage is probably the main thing that keeps players coming back for more, not honest fun, as well as luck of possibly pulling few magical headshots. Slow-down when being hit doesn't seem to be good idea either, making it harder to get away from the choke points. And random spread is not actually random, it just randomly follows one of the pre-set pattern. And yes, if you will learn them, you will be able to control your shooting better and get on top. Exactly what puts apart newbiews and elites, and exactly what elites seem to boast about when they want to say that Counter-Strike 1.6 is the best because it takes more skills and time to learn, with artifical challenges like this one that makes little sense. And well, once you spend your time to learn them, you will still find out on top that it didn't make the game any more amazing.  But you know, it's not too bad. It does teamwork well. Sometimes the game just works. When you work along the team, round the corners and storming the next room, where you follow teammates, supporting each other. Provide covering fire to the corner. When upon entering next place, each one covers his own direction, as some of the rooms just have too many places from which enemies can shoot you (smoke grenade and flashbangs help in these cases). And it's pretty damn nice at those moments, until they get ruined by something stupid, something you don't feel like could be prevented. Yea, getting shot by sniper.  And yes, this game has good enough sounds. No music, sadly. The graphics are quite HL1 high-definition era, but otherwise are fine enough. The levels are a bit of bland though.  Can't really recommend it. Because everybody who will like such games are already playing it. And player base of this game had too much time by now, that they will be just way too skilled for new players, who will just get destroyed and it will take a long time to get onto same level. It's not like there aren't enough military/realistical shooters anyway.",-1,1

You might say that CS:GO turned crap once Valve added cases and payed cosmetics, and in turn that makes CS 1.6 better than CS:GO.

10,"Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is the current iteration of Valve’s top-in-class competitive shooter, and the first to be maintained in the very modern way it has been. Learning from its experience with Team Fortress 2, Valve has a miniature economy in CS: GO that revolves entirely around gun decals. Players get a few ‘drops’ a week after matches, which can be a gun decal or a weapon crate – the latter of which cost £1.49 to unlock with a one-use key from the store. Obviously this economy is tailor-made, and so there are extraordinarily rare and mysteriously fantastic-looking gun and knife skins (with prices in the hundreds of pounds), then a large range of other skins tapering down to the common-as-muck variety that trades for pennies.  I don’t pay much attention to the CS: GO economy as a whole, though it’s interesting enough, but it’s important for a non-player to understand that a big chunk of the game’s audience takes it very seriously indeed. In the days after a new Operation launches countless forum threads are launched about the value of the new goods, whether someone should sell this new rare drop they got or hold it for a while, Twitch streams with giveaways and 50 crates being unlocked and so on. You get the picture.    I give such context on CS: GO’s economy because – even though it is a subsidiary part of the game to many including myself – it is the molten core of Operation Vanguard. CS: GO is a regularly-patched game but the major updates come in the form of Operations that introduce new maps and new skins, at the price of around £3 for an access pass – with the nice touch that maps are available to all players regardless, or made so shortly afterwards.  To give an exhaustive history of Operations would be no more useful than a general overview. If you play Counter-Strike then the chances are you play a lot of Counter-Strike. What the Operations do is freshen things up a bit – naturally they don’t disrupt the regular Dust-Mirage-Inferno cycle of competitive play, but you get some unfamiliar environments to tool about in, the chance to score some fancy new weapons, and in the context of a game you play almost daily, £3 a few times a year is chicken feed.  Operation Vanguard is different, and the changes are not for the better. The first problem I have with it is major: the way it’s sold seems to skirt the borderline of deception. To participate in Operation Breakout you bought an ‘All-Access Pass’ for £2.39. To participate in Operation Vanguard I bought an ‘Access Pass’ for £2.39. The difference is obvious side-by-side, but of course when OV popped up in Counter-Strike’s home menu I bought it more or less instantly, thinking this was the same thing.  OV’s selling point is two ‘campaigns,’ a series of missions with three branching paths. The missions are things like ‘Win 16 rounds on map X’ and ‘Kill 20 chickens in Deathmatch mode,’ and completing one bags a pre-determined award – either a weapon crate or a random weapon from a specified collection. So far, so OK. But in fact OV has two more campaigns, both of which cost £1.79 to access – which follow more or less the same pattern.    To be crystal-clear about this, the money is not the problem. I’m happy to pay for Operations, and OV’s combined total of around £6 in the context of the time I put into Counter-Strike is really not an issue. But that switch from ‘All-Access Pass’ to ‘Access Pass (with the right to buy more access)’, just ♥♥♥♥♥♥ me right off.  First of all I felt conned. I bought the OV pass in the same way I’d bought all the previous Operation passes, expected it to be the same deal, and realised I’d been fooled by the removal of ‘All.’ Secondly, what the two ‘extra’ purchases offer is basically a re-skinned version of OV’s mission book. But thirdly, and this is the real killer, you’re encouraged to buy them to self-medicate the most egregious, enormous, climactically wrong and frankly offensive design decision in Vanguard.  There are multi-day cooldowns on missions. That’s right Rambo, you may have thought you were buying another set of missions and drops to liven up day-to-day business in CS: GO, but in fact Vanguard is a campaign designed to play out over a set period of time, with the only limiting factor a bald external one: cooldown timers.  Let me set the scene for you. I love Counter-Strike. I saw Vanguard was out on a Thursday, and cleared Friday night. Got in a few beers. Booted it up and bought the pass. I played the first mission, cleared it in about 15 minutes. Chose a second, the killing chickens one, and that was another 15 mins. So around half an hour into my evening of joy I was given a four-day cooldown for the next mission.    You can slice this any way you want, but it’s ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. The sad thing is I get the thought process behind it. Consider: you’re Valve, in charge of a game where players (a) want new content but (b) put in so many hours that they’ll rush through anything almost instantly. For example, mission chains. Operation Breakout introduced missions in the form of random drops, which parcelled them out over time but had no larger arc. It was fine but the missions never felt… important. So Operation Vanguard’s missions are in structured patterns, with defined rewards, and are given the desired longevity through simple brute force of timing. You will not complete this content before we say so, because you can’t.  Oh, except that if you buy the extra mission packs, your cooldowns decrease across the board, because now you’re allowed to do more missions in a set period. That’s right. You’re basically paying to reduce cooldowns. In a Valve game.  The thing is that Operation Vanguard is only a ‘campaign’ in the same way that a pile of biscuits is ‘lunch.’ The missions are basic objectives like ‘Win 16 competitive rounds on Season’ or ‘Get 100 FAMAS kills in Deathmatch mode.’ And what do you get for completing them? Either a drop from an existing collection of guns, with a minor chance of a rare gun, or a weapon crate. The first is fair enough, but the second… I mean, at this point I already felt pretty rinsed by Operation Vanguard, and now it’s ‘rewarding’ me with crates that I need to pay more money to open.    There is a school of thought that says Valve has done this in order that a flood of new crates and mission rewards doesn’t flood the in-game economy, instead trickling them in over the coming months. To that argument the only appropriate response is – who cares? I play Counter-Strike: GO because it’s a great game, I don’t play it because of the economy, and while I accept the latter is how Valve makes money, the moment it starts intruding into the game – if indeed this explanation holds water – then the economy is not acting in the way that it should. That is, it should be improving the experience rather than throttling it.  The sad thing is that Operation Vanguard comes with my favourite selection of community maps yet, including two in Season and Back Alley that feel like potential classics. Yeah they’re all over the place in terms of favouring one side or the other, but this is par for the course with CS: GO and will be tweaked over the coming months. Every CS: GO operation freshens the game up with some new environments if nothing else, and the point of Operation Vanguard’s structure is to elongate this beyond a few days – to really showcase these excellent maps by forcing people to play on them semi-regularly for missions. It at least manages this.  I want to emphasise that I’m an enormous fan and c",-1,0

10,"I first played Counter-Strike back in 1999, when it was still just a mod. I went to it on a daily basis, for several hours, as my main source of entertainment and gathering of friends until about 2002, when other activities came along. I only went back to it now, in 2012. This unveiled the greatest disappointment and proof of destruction of a game I have ever experienced. As it is today, this is not Counter-Strike. It is a broken, unrecognizable, nearly useless form of the original game. Valve has let this game rot to death and still make an easy profit for nothing. The server browser is a joke. It is simply broken. The results it returns are completely inaccurate and all servers you will find are run by non-Steam users, with the game settings altered to who knows what, and 90% of them playing the Dust map. The other servers are running non-official maps and pointless game modes. In addition, you can not set your client to disallow the automatic download of custom server sounds or other trash that is force-fed through your connection to alter the game. Counter-Strike has been so blatantly abandoned, that it is shocking Valve still charges something for it. You will also see advertisements while you are connecting to the servers, and while you wait for the next round once you have been killed. Counter-Strike is the epitome of falling from grace and becoming an outright failure. It has become an embarrassment and a gaming tragedy.  Counter-Strike is bad.",-1,1

More, you'll inevitably (especially in 1.6) run into players so good that you'll be unsure whether they're superlative gamers or superlative cheaters. And in Counter-Strike, there's really no way of telling. Prepare yourself for frustration, either way.   Avoid.",-1,0

10,"This will be more of a ''my experience with this game'' type of review, because saying things like ''great gameplay'' will not suit something I've experienced with Counter-Strike. Here you go:  I remember back in 2002 I was at a friend's house and he was playing a game. I didn't know the name of the game nor I had internet to find it. A few weeks passed by and another friend came over and he didn't have a computer, so he brought a disc with a game in it. He told me that it was one of the best games and from that very moment I knew that it is going to be the game I saw at the other friend's house. When I saw the Counter-Strike logo I was filled with gamegasm (?) and I was so happy. I don't remember a day when I was so happy like back then. So, the journey started. I was playing it hardcore. Made friends, clans, was involved in communities and even made two myself. Counter-Strike is my first game which I played competitively and it was a whole experience. Playing public servers and maybe some servers with mods was very fun, but playing it competitively made it very intense and stressful. In a pleasant way, ofcourse.  Shooters these days try to be different, advanced in a way. Sometimes the most simple games like Counter-Strike are the ones that live to this day. Also, there are plenty of mods to keep your attention to this game. The gameplay is very simple - defend as a Counter-Terrorist, attack as a Terrorist to plant the bomb or save the hostages as a CT. I am sure most of you already know this and I doubt there are gamers that haven't heard or know the gameplay of Counter-Strike, so I am sharing here more of my experience.  I wish I could find my CS Anthology account which I've lost since 2008. So, I decided I am going to buy this game again and here you go - more than a thousand hours played. I still play it from time to time to this day and it brings back many great memories and I sometimes even stumble upon people I've played with years ago. I think Counter-Strike changed gaming in a major way and we wouldn't have many games like we have today, if this game wouldn't exist.   I am sure many of people already have played games like CS:GO, but never the roots. I doubt any of you will play it for more than an hour, because it's much more simple and it differs a lot in my opinion from CS:GO and modern games.  I am glad that I lived through the golden era of shooters and if I'd have to rate it, it'd 10/10 ofcourse,",1,0

10,"Welcome to the world’s most fun over rated pile of ♥♥♥♥.   Since I first got a PC nearly 3 years ago all I have ever heard is counter strike, counter strike, counter strike. And, after about 15 hours of play time I see why.   Right away I can see that when counter strike came out it was the magnum opus of the fps/multiplayer genre and I can respect that but that also explains the largest problem with counter strike, its nonexistent learning curve. For the first maybe 3 hours I played on a few different servers and never killed a single person. I figured I’m new to this and it seems as thoe these guys/girls have been playing much longer than I have been so I began to brush it off and then 2 hours and may servers later I had killed maybe 6 people, not much had changed. And then remembered that that’s stupid, I shouldn’t be playing against people that have 150 hours clocked while I have 5.  Another problem is the weapons  I can understand the weird names, Valve would have been a smaller company then and saved a buck by naming them weird stuff but that doesn’t mean I won’t still make fun of them. The damaged ratio is also complete ♥♥♥♥♥. The sniper rifle is a one hit kill the subs are useless and I was once hit across the map with a shot gun blast. The knife is a bit under powered but Thats better than it being a light saber. And For some reason the only guns that are ever used are the AK look alike the M16 look alike and the sniper rifle.   I should say that counter strike is not a bad a game. It's for sure a sextillion times better than any Call of Duty ever made. And I will confess that this game is more fun giving your friends ADHD kid a gram of cocaine and telling him his dad is made of candy. But it’s also as frustrating as trying to put that same kid in a car seat. ",1,0

Makes me a lil giddy sometimes, and compared to the graphics and simulation of today's shooters the quality is pretty ♥♥♥♥ (I'm prepared for some flak), but really, it's like that bottle of wine that has aged and mellowed on the beloved alcohol shelf *hic*...NOTHING can beat the classics.

10,"This game is not only the best game of the fps gender ever made but it is also the best game ever PERIOD. It is literally hundreds of games in one. You can drive cars, fly helicopters, fly planes, fly tie fighters, shoot lasers, play volleyball, play soccer, play football, play hide and go seek, ride bicycles, play dodgeball, immerse yourself in the warcraft world, be a superhero, be a surfer, be a rock climber. Oh yeah, you could also be a terrorist or counter-terrorist and plant/defuse bombs on dust 1 or dust 2. There are other maps but you don't really discover them until 10,000 hours in. But once you do it opens you up to a whole new world of wonders. This game gets a 10/10. The only games that compete are other version of counter-strike, Team Fortress Classic, and Day of Defeat.

10,I played this game when it was just a third party mod for half life. I cant tell you how many hours of my life I spent fragging my friends.

10,"There really isn't much to say about this game that most people don't already know. It is a classic in any and every definition of the word. Although the graphics are now considered quite dated, it somehow doesn't change the appeal and visual accessibility of the game itself. Perhaps newer gamers and people trying it out for the first time in today's gaming world will never develop a bond that veteran CS players will forever cherish with the old school counter-strike, but for us, this game will always be the go-to first person shooter and will endure as the trend-setting sage of all future shooting games to come. Rivaled only by the likes of the Battlefield series (though obviously not comparable as they are essentially different games albeit being first-person shooters both), counter-strike is an absolute treasure and for the pennies you could snatch it for, it is definitely worth your while as well.

When developers of this game genre learn that this 2 things are the most inportant for good FPS, they will make a game as good as CS 1.6 is... CS:GO does not have these major aspects, and doesn't deserve name of Counter-Strike (IMO). As a third very important thing for FPS game, I would say the animations... The animations of player models such as runnig, walking, crouching, gun holding/fireing/reloading etc...

10,"The classic shooter upgraded with modern controls: Counter-Strike was something unseen, yet highly needed in the late 90's and early 00's. It carried with it the idea that you didn't need a single player 'story mode' to make ripples in the video game industry. As future competitors would attempt to reflect, all CS needed was an incredible skill-based gameplay with a start-of-the-art ability to play against players from around the world. Toss in some alternate gameplay styles to help break up the chance of monotonous moments and throw it all over a large assortment of levels for good measure; you’ll end up with a dish that, for years, has been best served with a dedicated server and a good group of friends. It's no wonder that CS gave birth to some of the best online team play the world has ever seen and continues in that tradition to this day. If you haven't played the original Counter-Strike yet, you're missing a small part of your soul... hurry, go get it back by quick scoping with an AWP down Long A on de_dust2.",1,0

At the time the gameplay was perfect ! the game was really easy to handle and understand, the graphisme ? When it came out it was really good and enough, then the game never grew up and we never had patchs / new versions. But it was still fine as long as we could all developpe our skill and create new strats.  We got a lot of mods like zombie deathmatch gungame jail and for me the best mods Hide'N'Seek, Kz, Deathrun etc...  To be honest those years were truly a pleasure to play.  Thank you so much to create a game like that.  Without counting that now we have new versions and eSport is growing everyday!",1,0

10,"The developers of the Half-Life Mod, Counter-Strike really knew what they were doing when they said they wanted to construct a mod like no other. It was, like Half-Life, something new for the public to lay their bored eyes on. There never before was a mod about Terrorism vs Counter Terrorism, and thanks to the two developers of the game, it happened. Why Terorrism vs Counter Terrorism though? It was only something new and that is it. It was something to literally 'wow' the public with intense competitive multiplayer gameplay. It was something people actually payed attention to and thought it off as a sport. So fourth, this mod has been recognized so much that more installments have appeared, and that is an amazing thing for a game that once started off as a mod. Just like Team Fortress and how that continued on into Team Fortress 2. I have yet to play Global Offensive but I will do that some time in the future.  Its games like these that always amaze me with their originality. And I believe Counter-Strike is one of those games that deserves to be noticed and introduced to FPS fans across the world.   This is a must buy/play.",1,0

10,"Counter-Strike 1.6 is easily one of the best shooters out there. I have good history of making teams and playing against other teams or just having fun with friends in public servers. It was out of this world when it came out and in my opinion had the best professional scene at the time. I played it on and off for about 7 years.   Bud sadly CS 1.6 doesn't hold up for me. Until playing CSGO I was still very into the game. After playing CSGO for few months I tried playing CS 1.6 again, but the graphics and shooting mechanics are just awful at this point, it just doesn't hold up.  If you are new to gaming or just Counter-Strike, you should probably skip this game and just go right to Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. It's an amazing upgrade from an amazing game.",1,0

10,"Death is a great teacher. Failure in Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is, as it always has been for this series, the greatest way to learn where you should have gone, what you shouldn't have done, and how you could have done better. Counter-Strike players spend a lot of time learning -- consequently, they are always getting better.  Growth is an important factor in Global Offensive, especially if you're coming into Counter-Strike fresh or after a sabbatical. This is an extremely hardcore, skill-based first-person shooter, and it forces you to think differently than other modern shooters. If you’re a Call of Duty player, you’re going to need to change your play style to succeed here. Counter-Strike also tries developing into something new here as well, despite doing little to push itself beyond what it’s always done best. Global Offensive modifies old maps to keep veterans on their toes, and introduces official new modes that encourage different play styles for the first time in almost 15 years.  For the uninitiated, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is a small-scale, team-based first-person shooter with permanent death. When a counter-terrorist kills a terrorist planting explosives in a classic Defusal match, or a CT escort swallows a sniper round in Hostage Rescue, the victim is dead for good and doesn't respawn until the next round. As such, players on both sides must exercise skill and care. The bomb objective, meanwhile, gives everyone a purpose. Of course matches end when everyone on a team is dead, but a clever and coordinated terrorist team will give the CTs the slip, plant their bomb, and protect the bomb site. Between rounds, everyone spends earned cash on better gear and guns, and the cycle continues.  Pieces of the Counter-Strike formula are dated at this point, but the superb heart and soul of Global Offensive is timeless. Teams are small, guns are lethal, and rounds are short. There's an addictive just-one-more-round quality to it, because there's a constant desire to do better than last time, to earn a satisfying kill, or to win in a new way. Call of Duty and Battlefield vets will wonder why they can't sprint to escape enemy fire or look down the iron sights to improve aim; Counter-Strike players will feel like they walked into their redecorated home. Certain map redesigns will catch hardcore fans off guard, but the changes are for the best -- the underpass choke point in de_dust, for instance, has a new escape route.  Even in the face of genre evolution, Global Offensive doesn’t care to adapt. CSGO is so dedicated to Counter-Strike's aging ideals despite market and trend changes that it brute-forces its way to success. Part of what makes it such an engaging competitive game is that killing in Global Offensive requires a wholly different skill set than other shooters. Everyone is limited to what they have and can see, with little room for character modification or on-the-fly advantages. Running and gunning is a useless play style, even if you've bought a helmet and kevlar that round, to the point that someone standing still is more likely to score the kill. Walking, crouching, or standing are your best bets to reduce the inaccurate spray of machine-gun fire.  Consequently, killing in Global Offensive feels good. There's a sickening sensation to dropping someone dead because you know they're not coming back. It's also satisfying knowing you used limited resources to play smarter than your victim. If players aren't watching corners, providing covering fire, or using smoke grenades and flashbangs, they're more likely to take a headshot from a more delicate and patient triggerman. The desire to experience that distinct feeling is a strong motivator to keep playing, even when you're getting steamrolled by an obviously better team.  If you've played Counter-Strike before, Global Offensive probably sounds a whole lot like Counter-Strike. Like Counter-Strike: Source before it, Global Offensive exists simply to modernize the look of the classic competitive shooter, while doing little to disrupt the core form and function. At the same time, it does enough to color outside the lines of tradition to justify your time and effort.  Fire is one of the most interesting new combat variables. Molotov cocktails and incendiary grenades either roast groups of guys or force them in another direction. Flames are a useful distraction or scare tactic, too. They're particularly useful during Demolition matches, which focus the fight at a single bomb site rather than giving terrorists two to pick between. The new and modified maps in this mode aren't as big as classic Counter-Strike arenas – entire sections have been cut off to direct teams toward a central location – but their thoughtful design is as intricate as ever. The Lake map is a standout -- there's a wide open yet densely populated yard around the bomb site, which is inside a sizable lakeside home with plenty of vantage points and hiding spots. To separate Demolition from Defusal, players can't buy between rounds. Instead, it takes a cue from the other new mode, Arms Race, in which each kill unlocks another weapon instantly. The better you do, the more you have to switch up the way you play, and because Demolition is so fast you'll need to be quick on your feet.  Unlike other game types, Arms Race allows for respawns. It's the most chaotic and care-free mode in Global Offensive, with players throwing caution to the wind for the sake of climbing the kill ladder as quickly as possible. It's a shame there are only two maps in Arms Race -- a problem that will more likely persist on consoles than PC.  If you have the option, playing the PC version is unquestionably the best way to experience Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. Mods, mouse and keyboard, and the usual PC-only options are better than the ports. Plus, Valve is much better about long-term PC support -- it abandoned Team Fortress 2 on consoles, and Portal 2's level editor was PC exclusive. If you prefer to play on consoles, Global Offensive is the same great game.",1,0

10,"I do not have much to say on Counter-Strike/CS:1.6 but with it being the first stand-alone game modification for Half Life using the (Gold) Source Development Kit it turned out pretty well even in the 1.0/1.5 mod, oh yes and the hostages on 1.0 where scientists, due to the fact the developers didn't make some hostage NPC models in time for the release and the Hostage models where still NPCS and came out later in 1.6. And during Beta Version 4 (B-V4) Valve became interested in the game that was being developed, hired the developers for valve to help make it better, and in a few years the original developers quit making the game and let Valve take control of it. If you like the classic First Person Shooters from around 1995-2002 this is basically the game for you. Also you can shoot through almost every wall with every gun in the game.

10,"This will be more of a ''my experience with this game'' type of review, because saying things like ''great gameplay'' will not suit something I've experienced with Counter-Strike. Here you go:  I remember back in 2002 I was at a friend's house and he was playing a game. I didn't know the name of the game nor I had internet to find it. A few weeks passed by and another friend came over and he didn't have a computer, so he brought a disc with a game in it. He told me that it was one of the best games and from that very moment I knew that it is going to be the game I saw at the other friend's house. When I saw the Counter-Strike logo I was filled with gamegasm (?) and I was so happy. I don't remember a day when I was so happy like back then. So, the journey started. I was playing it hardcore. Made friends, clans, was involved in communities and even made two myself. Counter-Strike is my first game which I played competitively and it was a whole experience. Playing public servers and maybe some servers with mods was very fun, but playing it competitively made it very intense and stressful. In a pleasant way, ofcourse.  Shooters these days try to be different, advanced in a way. Sometimes the most simple games like Counter-Strike are the ones that live to this day. Also, there are plenty of mods to keep your attention to this game. The gameplay is very simple - defend as a Counter-Terrorist, attack as a Terrorist to plant the bomb or save the hostages as a CT. I am sure most of you already know this and I doubt there are gamers that haven't heard or know the gameplay of Counter-Strike, so I am sharing here more of my experience.  I wish I could find my CS Anthology account which I've lost since 2008. So, I decided I am going to buy this game again and here you go - more than a thousand hours played. I still play it from time to time to this day and it brings back many great memories and I sometimes even stumble upon people I've played with years ago. I think Counter-Strike changed gaming in a major way and we wouldn't have many games like we have today, if this game wouldn't exist.   I am sure many of people already have played games like CS:GO, but never the roots. I doubt any of you will play it for more than an hour, because it's much more simple and it differs a lot in my opinion from CS:GO and modern games.  I am glad that I lived through the golden era of shooters and if I'd have to rate it, it'd 10/10 ofcourse,",1,0

Shooters these days try to be different, advanced in a way. Sometimes the most simple games like Counter-Strike are the ones that live to this day. Also, there are plenty of mods to keep your attention to this game. The gameplay is very simple - defend as a Counter-Terrorist, attack as a Terrorist to plant the bomb or save the hostages as a CT. I am sure most of you already know this and I doubt there are gamers that haven't heard or know the gameplay of Counter-Strike, so I am sharing here more of my experience.  I wish I could find my CS Anthology account which I've lost since 2008. So, I decided I am going to buy this game again and here you go - more than a thousand hours played. I still play it from time to time to this day and it brings back many great memories and I sometimes even stumble upon people I've played with years ago. I think Counter-Strike changed gaming in a major way and we wouldn't have many games like we have today, if this game wouldn't exist.  I am sure many of people already have played games like CS:GO, but never the roots. I doubt any of you will play it for more than an hour, because it's much more simple and it differs a lot in my opinion from CS:GO and modern games.  I am glad that I lived through the golden era of shooters and if I'd have to rate it, it'd 10/10 ofcourse,",1,0

Tears welled up in his eyes when he realized what exactly was at stake. He gave it up immediately. Three years later he died of lung cancer. It was really sad and destroyed me. My mother said to me: 'Don't ever smoke. Please don't put your family through what your Grandfather put us through.' I agreed. At 28, I have never touched a cigarette. I must say, I feel a very slight sense of regret for never having done it, because this game gave me cancer anyway.",1,1

How can I describe this game? What one phrase summarizes the ostensive thrust of epic time sink that is Counter-Strike?   Easy - 'just one more round!' And the whirlpool of regret washes over you as dusk turns to dawn and you realize that you didn't study for your freakin' biology exam. For shame. Too bad this box isn't large enough to contain my stories of grand LAN parties. Needless to say, this was an amazing game.  Though after years passing, the humor lies in sadness that the same 13 year olds that I left behind are still playing.. Worse yet, they're being domineered by server admins who are exactly 1 year older! (I figure a bedtime extension merits you the ability to ban &amp; kick players).

This was the game that was seen on the computer screens of the LAN parties, tournaments and other major computer related events.  It's action-packed, skill-based and it had a huge following. Even today you may find lots of server filled with players. The gameplay surrounds around you and your team. If you play the 'DE maps' you're a terrorist, you must plant the bomb and make sure that the CT's won't defuse it and if you're in the CT team, you must defuse the bomb before it goes off. If you play the 'CS maps' you must rescue the hostages as a CT and if you're on the terrorist team you must keep the hostages held-up and eliminate any CT that tries to stop you. Any round can also be won by eliminating the opponents.  This game spawned a franchise and will always be remembered as one of the starting grounds of multiplayer, teambased first-person-shooters.  The game is from 2000 and is outdated by its succesor; Global Offensive. But if you're into old games, you should check this out but I highly doubt you haven't heard of this game before.",1,0

10,"This will be more of a ''my experience with this game'' type of review, because saying things like ''great gameplay'' will not suit something I've experienced with Counter-Strike. Here you go:  I remember back in 2002 I was at a friend's house and he was playing a game. I didn't know the name of the game nor I had internet to find it. A few weeks passed by and another friend came over and he didn't have a computer, so he brought a disc with a game in it. He told me that it was one of the best games and from that very moment I knew that it is going to be the game I saw at the other friend's house. When I saw the Counter-Strike logo I was filled with gamegasm (?) and I was so happy. I don't remember a day when I was so happy like back then. So, the journey started. I was playing it hardcore. Made friends, clans, was involved in communities and even made two myself. Counter-Strike is my first game which I played competitively and it was a whole experience. Playing public servers and maybe some servers with mods was very fun, but playing it competitively made it very intense and stressful. In a pleasant way, ofcourse.  Shooters these days try to be different, advanced in a way. Sometimes the most simple games like Counter-Strike are the ones that live to this day. Also, there are plenty of mods to keep your attention to this game. The gameplay is very simple - defend as a Counter-Terrorist, attack as a Terrorist to plant the bomb or save the hostages as a CT. I am sure most of you already know this and I doubt there are gamers that haven't heard or know the gameplay of Counter-Strike, so I am sharing here more of my experience.  I wish I could find my CS Anthology account which I've lost since 2008. So, I decided I am going to buy this game again and here you go - more than a thousand hours played. I still play it from time to time to this day and it brings back many great memories and I sometimes even stumble upon people I've played with years ago. I think Counter-Strike changed gaming in a major way and we wouldn't have many games like we have today, if this game wouldn't exist.  I am sure many of people already have played games like CS:GO, but never the roots. I doubt any of you will play it for more than an hour, because it's much more simple and it differs a lot in my opinion from CS:GO and modern games.  I am glad that I lived through the golden era of shooters and if I'd have to rate it, it'd 10/10 ofcourse,",1,0

10,"So, this game have poor graphics and it's really old, but it still awesome.  This game is based on strategy team work game, that's why i love Counter Strike games.  Yes ... almost all FPS are based on teamwork. But Counter Strike 1.6 is special, you play just for play (no rewards), here you can improve your teamwork to play other games, for example! Or you can simply kill players with no reason... The community have already sent some funny mods for this game and it's currently running in some servers you can join (Zombie Mode, Deathrun, Jailbreak,...). Repetitive? Well it depends on you, if you play all time in the same map in same gamemode, of course is repetitive, but if you make pcw(team/clan war) with your friends in alternated maps, the game will never be repetitive.",1,0

10,"The hand models, animations, weapon textures, and custom maps all make this game an enjoyable experience. Oh yeah but just add functional bots so I dont have to download ♥♥♥♥♥♥ Z-Bots, which, are not realistic in any way possible (aimbot, movement patterns, staring contests with enemies).  Although the game is a classic representation of how modernized tactical shooters should be produced, the hackers are always going to be there to ruin the fun. Also, some seriously dysfunctional hit detection occurs during most matches. Also, not trying to be too judgemental, but the game would have been a lot easier to play if the crosshairs had center dots. I say this because Source and G.O. have center crosshair dots, which make aiming much more persistent.   ***8.5/10***  Final Statement:  It's a damn ugly game, but that's what makes it good. Once modded, it can look like it runs on a completely different engine. However, the detail and missing physics are not present due to the limitations of GoldSrc's dated capabilities. Oh, and this game does not deserve to be ran with mods. Just simple and complex retextures of the weapons provided within the game. I would like to tell you that this game is better than Source and G.O., but half the community sticks to the newer iterations rather than the original.",1,0

10,"Hey there! Remember all the good old gaming days? Searching for mix teams, joining up with some random dudes playing all night long? Totally missing some school days here and there? Then you probably, like me, played this game countless of hours.    You know all the default maps better than your first name and have surely tested out thousands of custom maps, hundreds of aim-maps, hundreds of KZ/jumping maps, Warcraft 3 mod (a mod to a game that was a mod, how ironic?), Zombie-mod, gungame mod, evenly and evilly slaughtered all your friends in deathmatch, met thousands of players from all around the world, even from Africa and pwned unimaginable amounts of hardcore and noob-players.    This game will absolutely never die, players will keep trying to find and therefor create new servers and the old PCW/mix-games are still going to be played in the silent even though the competetive gaming scene has gone over to CS:GO. And thank you scene for doing that. This game really needs the cult status in the shadow of newer and more refreshing games. Let it still be there, reminding newer generation of players how the good old times were. Let all the videos be there on youtube especially of the bigger contests. It makes me happy.   So, what is this game all about?  Well, it is simple. The main theme of the game is either 'bomb-planting terrorists vs bomb-defusing counter-terrorists', 'hostage-rescue-mode' or 'save the VIP-mode'. A competetive first person shooter game that has immersive action-packed gameplay all over your screen. You will most likely be flashed, smoked out, shot from far away by a sniper, spawnkilled by your sister, knifed by your brother, exploded by either a bomb or a thrown HE-granade or camped to death by a noob. Sounds good? Then join in the action! You are not just late, you are very late!",1,0

Since then the Counter-Strike franchise has only expanded and has only increased its esports realm. The original counter-strike may lack in graphics for today's standards however for its time it was awesome.  I enjoyed AS_ maps like oilrig, arctic, and various other maps that are no longer in the 'mainstream cs:go scene'.  10/10 - Sometimes I play this to remember the good times.

10,"I didn't even play this game when I first reviewed it what the ♥♥♥♥ why did I review this  Counter-Strike. If you don't know what this game is, you should probably slap yourself and stop playing games because this ♥♥♥♥ literally founded multiplayer first-person shooters.  Okay, not 'founded', Quake did that first but it sure as hell helped them develop into what they are today.  While the graphics definitely haven't held up to standards today (kind of obvious since this game was released in ♥♥♥♥ING 2000 AND STARTED DEVELOPMENT IN 1999), this game is still fun. Why? There's a lot more maps in the game, and as a result of low graphical quality, it's a LOT easier to run on old systems or just bad systems in general. And the gameplay is still just as fun as CS:S or even CS:GO.  This game used to still be the 3rd most played game on Steam next to Team Fortress 2 (  ) and Dota 2, but that changed when CS:GO actually started to become a good game back in 2013. Now there's really only the most dedicated CS players that play this game.  I don't recommend going into this game unless you're a dedicated CS veteran who wants to relive the history of CS and see what the first game got everyone hyped for. This game's great, I'm not going to lie, it's just the learning curve as of right now is STEEP. And that can be good or bad for some people.  I'm definitely going to be spending more time in this game in the future just so I can get hours in the game and act like I'm actually good at Counter-Strike for once. That's about it, though.

No other game on this planet has given me more entertainment and enjoyment than Counter-Strike 1.6 has and I doubt no game ever will.  Reason i've only got 38 hours here is because I no longer use the account I originally played cs 1.6 on.   func_vehicle is what makes this Counter Strike game the best out of all the others in the franchise.  Find a server that has car maps or maps with func_vehicle entities and you will have endless fun running over teammates and enemies in all kinds of hilarious and goofy vehicles not giving a care in the world.  You can drive a fork with a meatball on the end of it. Do i need to say more?  Mods on this game are amazing too. There is a mod where you can catch pokemon, level them up, train them and use their skills. Call of Duty mod that is suprisingly better than cod its self, Warcraft mods, zombie mods, basebuilder and so on...

10,"First of all, let me start by saying this game used to be my religion 10 years ago, so I am probably biased.  So many years after its inception, the graphics for Counter-Strike do look pretty dated. of Compared to the quality standards of most of today's shooters, the original Counter-Strike (and likely its predecessors, which very much live in the same vein) may feel a bit rough, unpolished or even at times a bit corny (hostage sounds :p). Still, at it's core, the game is a fast-paced, trigger-reflex shooter.  Edit: I forgot to also include that you can use 'high definition' skins, textures and remodels for pretty much all assets in the game, so the game does have some degree of leeway and customization visually. Back in the day that was one of the things that made this game the bees knees for me. Swapped out my in-game AUG with the model and txt information an LA80, hell yeah! Not a fan of desert eagles? How does a .44 magnum revolver give you the feels? You can also edit the sound files. I remember downloading some sound pack that made Rob Zombie's Dragula play as the round start sound effect and it was almost a month until I finally changed it, to the point where now, 10 years later, I still expect to hear Dragula when I play Counter-strike. These are the things that make me feel nostalgic and think of the late 90s and early 2000; they became iconic for me.   This game is all about making your shots count before the other guy gets his in. Deaths come quickly, wins feel rewarding. The games are split up into objective-based perma-death rounds. If you are a terrorist, you may have to plant a bomb (edgy, I know, but remember how old this game is- concepts came way before 9/11 and the explosion of modern terrorism, etc) and if you found yourself on the Counter-terrorist team, your objective would be to find and secure or disarm the bomb before it's detonated. Each round can also be completed deathmatch style by wiping out the enemy team (indeed, this will usually happen in most cases as each team pushes towards their respective objective)  Occasionally, due to the respectable size and intelligent layout of the maps, there will come situations where there are only one or two players left alive on each team and both teams must aggressively pursue the objective. You've never experienced tension until you have 40 seconds to defuse a bomb and you don't know where the devil who planted it went. You attempt to disarm it while there's still time. You hear footsteps behind you. Your hair trigger reflexes can save you. Will you come out on top?  There are still hundreds, maybe thousands of public Counter strike servers available, and a good number of players to populate them (though many servers are ghost or bot servers also). Most of them (95%) will run some sort of addons and plugins but they install automatically on the fly as needed on your client so you dont have to worry about extra downloads. These addons will range from subtle things that enhance game functions like realtime stats, to comical sound effects (I've heard the 'HEAD SHOT!' callout from Unreal Tournament in CS more than I have from playing any UT game) to absolutely ridiculous and gamechanging, to the leveling Warcraft 3 hero addon where you can get a chain lightning spell XD to being able to deploy a parachute whenever you want to to avoid any fall damage.  It is a bit old, so if that word alone scares you you may want to avoid the original CS (and possibly the newer ones as well, as they play very similarly) but if you enjoyed the Half-Life series (the engine) and you like modern shooters and want to try one with some good pace, try Counter-Strike. Where a game of Call of Duty or the like would typically degenerate into a full on bloodbath where nothing is sacred and everyone is shooting you from behind, Counter Strike has pacing; every round can play out completely different from the last, depending on the tactics used by each team and the route they choose to take towards their objective.   It's far from perfect, but it will always have a special place in my heart. &lt;3  There was a time, when, if you wanted to flashbang your team and hear their cries of anguish, this was pretty much the only game you could do it in.  10/10 for flashbang memories",1,0

I may only have 75 hours on this as of now but I used to play it all the time before I knew it was on steam. If your a person who doesn't mind graphics but likes counter strike I would definitely buy it because, while I don't necessarily like classic on this version all of the custom maps and game modes make well worth ten dollars. *Alert* A lot of the gun names and the amount of guns is pretty different from CS GO but there are probably guides and once you get past your first hour-ish its fine.",1,0

10,"The classic that set an entire subgenre of FPS games. I played the beta, and played that for YEARS before buying and installing 1.6. That's when I first got my Steam account. Then I got CS:Source. Then, it was others. Thirty games later, I still love the original CS. I was a member of 76th AD on Day of Defeat, and I regularly hung out on Vir's Pub in Vancouver long after the release of CS:S. There's a reason this game has more hours logged than any other for me (over 1400 hours, at last check); it never gets old. I sometimes have to remember to buy ammo, since CS:S tied ammo to the weapon, but this game was truly my first love in the FPS genre.  Seriously, just get it. It's always good to have the classic. And seriously—I only play CS and CS:S in the series; CS:GO's pay-to-win system is not what I look for in a game. Bide your time, build up your funds, and then unleash the fury. It's that simple. No, I'm not good enough to do pro gaming. I'm not even really good enough to make it on the amateur circuit. But I did get good enough to be an even match to my friends… all without paying for deus ex machina.   I don't play WoW for similar reasons: I refuse to pay a monthly fee to play a game. Yes, there are free (libre) servers out there. My stepson runs one. But the point is that if I buy the license to the game, I should be able to play all I want without having to pay a fee. Pay-to-win is arguably worse than pay-to-play; it creates an unbalanced play experience, and I refuse to participate in that.   Bearing that in mind, that's why I love CS and CS:S. It's just you, your skill, and an adversarial challenge. There's no buying your way to victory. I hope Valve can get back to that in future releases.",1,0

10,"This will be more of a ''my experience with this game'' type of review, because saying things like ''great gameplay'' will not suit something I've experienced with Counter-Strike. Here you go:  I remember back in 2002 I was at a friend's house and he was playing a game. I didn't know the name of the game nor I had internet to find it. A few weeks passed by and another friend came over and he didn't have a computer, so he brought a disc with a game in it. He told me that it was one of the best games and from that very moment I knew that it is going to be the game I saw at the other friend's house. When I saw the Counter-Strike logo I was filled with gamegasm (?) and I was so happy. I don't remember a day when I was so happy like back then. So, the journey started. I was playing it hardcore. Made friends, clans, was involved in communities and even made two myself. Counter-Strike is my first game which I played competitively and it was a whole experience. Playing public servers and maybe some servers with mods was very fun, but playing it competitively made it very intense and stressful. In a pleasant way, ofcourse.  Shooters these days try to be different, advanced in a way. Sometimes the most simple games like Counter-Strike are the ones that live to this day. Also, there are plenty of mods to keep your attention to this game. The gameplay is very simple - defend as a Counter-Terrorist, attack as a Terrorist to plant the bomb or save the hostages as a CT. I am sure most of you already know this and I doubt there are gamers that haven't heard or know the gameplay of Counter-Strike, so I am sharing here more of my experience.  I wish I could find my CS Anthology account which I've lost since 2008. So, I decided I am going to buy this game again and here you go - more than a thousand hours played. I still play it from time to time to this day and it brings back many great memories and I sometimes even stumble upon people I've played with years ago. I think Counter-Strike changed gaming in a major way and we wouldn't have many games like we have today, if this game wouldn't exist.  I am sure many of people already have played games like CS:GO, but never the roots. I doubt any of you will play it for more than an hour, because it's much more simple and it differs a lot in my opinion from CS:GO and modern games.  I am glad that I lived through the golden era of shooters and if I'd have to rate it, it'd 10/10 ofcourse,",1,0

10,"In its day, CS 1.6 was the shining example of a multiplayer FPS experience. It was just one of those games that, if you didn't own it, you were just statistically worse than everyone else. Oh, how the might have fallen. Nowadays, the game is plagued with a general lack of interest, as most of its fans have moved on to its vastly superior brothers, CSS and CSGO, and for good reason.  I would recommend playersonly play on servers they trust. This is because apparently one server overwrote all of my unused keys to connect to 'xdd.ms-shadow.ro:27015', which is also a server i would recommend avoiding at all costs.  This game is a relic, a fossil from an age of gaming long past.",-1,0

10,"CS:GO but with less features, more Russians, and graphics comparable to the original Half-Life.",1,0
10,I've played this game since I was around 6 years old back in 2002 and it still makes me laugh and have fun whenever I launch it to this very day. Over 12 years of endless entertainment. No other game on this planet has given me more entertainment and enjoyment than Counter-Strike 1.6 has and I doubt no game ever will.  Reason i've only got 38 hours here is because I no longer use the account I originally played cs 1.6 on.   func_vehicle is what makes this Counter Strike game the best out of all the others in the franchise.,1,1
10,"Counter-Strike is a multiplayer spin-off game to the Half Life franchise. Set in the same universe except focused on the HECU Marines themselves. There is no plot to this game, it's purpose is to establish a fun co-op multiplayer game that allows gamers to either fight it off or team up around the globe. There is a selection of different locations for the areas and different types of game play to create endless possible features wether you play as the marines or the terrorists is all up to you. This game was so successful it established a large fan base and spawn a few sequals. If you want to play a classic online multiplayer, you can't go more classic than this. If you manage to gather some friends who have their own Counter Strike games installed on their PC, then you will be all set.",1,0

10,"The game is perfectly designed and its graphics is incredible. The Counter Strike 1.6 game is specifically designed to offer shear fun and excitement for all young and old generation as well. The game tactics cannot be judged at ease as the targets and tasks change as per the assigned map location inside the game. In this game, the real challenges are like exploiting the opposition, diffusing the bomb, killing enemy with mere knife as a weapon and rescuing the hostages which are trapped at the weird locations. All in all, the tasks assigned in this game are never achievable in a time span of 5 minutes.  In some map of this game, the task is to win the round within 90 seconds which is quite impossible if you are playing the expert level. Also some of the team members don't follow your commands during the game which adds more delay in achieving the tasks. In such situations one has to have the accurate skills to win this game. So it is obvious that this game will take near about 2 months time to complete all the four modes like easy, normal, hard and expert. But if you love this game, and there is proper audio settings present at your machine, then there is no stopping and all modes of this game can be completed within few days or may be in few hours of time. Now in terms of speculation, it is seen that parents worry about their child playing offensive games and counter strike 1.6 is no excuse to this scenario. So children's should keep in mind that playing such games is for fun and they must themselves have control over the time which they devote towards this popular and addictive game.   The game is full of action and I feel that one who plays a counter strike game can perform the tasks like studying and other home related duties at a greater pace. But it is necessary that the gamers spend a lot of time on studying since balance between games and study has to be maintained at any cost. So the students who play this game should take care of home duties and study at first. At last if they find time, they have to invest it while playing this incredible game.",1,0

10,"  The CS1.6 is the successor to Thiel's CS1.5, a denizen of this magazine's 'Recommended Components' listing ever since Sam Tellig enthused over it in August 1994. (He also wrote about it in May '96, while Muse Kastanovich's November '95 review included a full set of measurements.) Like the '1.5, the '1.6 is a floorstanding two-way design with a sloped-back front baffle. That's where the resemblance ends, however, as every other aspect of the 2002 speaker's design is new.  Whereas the CS1.5's baffle was flat, with step-backs for the hefty grille, the '1.6's is elegantly sculpted with a CNC machine to optimize dispersion, the minimal grille fitting into a shallow depression and held with concealed magnets. With the grille removed, the most obvious visible feature is a long vertical slot beneath the woofer, surrounded by a machined flare. This slot acts as the reflex port, but its geometry is claimed to minimize wind noise and any modification of its tuning by the grille.  The 6.5' woofer, designed and manufactured in-house, uses a 3' voice-coil to drive the metal cone closer to its perimeter than usual. This is said to increase the stiffness of the cone, pushing the inevitable breakup modes much higher in frequency than with a conventional cone and voice-coil. The large coil allows the neodymium magnet to be housed completely within the voice-coil former, inherently shielding the magnet. The 1' tweeter uses a metal dome and, like the woofer, features a short coil with a copper distortion-reducing ring, operating in a long gap. The tweeter dome is recessed slightly in a front plate with a short flare, which will increase its on-axis sensitivity to match the efficient woofer, at the expense of restricting the unit's dispersion in the top octave.  The crossover is, as is usual in Thiel's Coherent Source designs, a phase-optimal first-order type. This and the sloping back baffle allow the sounds from both drivers to arrive at the listener's ears at the same time. In a welcome departure from earlier Thiel speakers, the CS1.6's sturdy terminal posts are sited on the rear of its cabinet rather than the base.  Sound  Setting up the CS1.6s involved finding positions for them that gave the optimum balance among four nonrelated aspects of sound quality. The speaker's bass region is intrinsically shelved-down. However, moving the speakers close to the sidewalls to give some boundary reinforcement of the low frequencies also emphasized some residual hardness in the low treble, and resulted in a balance that was too bright with the speakers facing straight ahead. Moving the speakers well away from the sidewalls gave a sound that was clean and clear, but with insufficient bass. Keeping the speakers where they had the most extended bass but toeing them in so that they faced the listening seat reduced the hardness, added some useful top-octave air, and gave a soundstage that was superbly detailed and stable. On the downside, the overall sound was still a little bright for my tastes and system.  Ultimately, I moved each speaker forward along the line joining its acoustic center to the listening position, noting how the drop in bass weight was balanced by a corresponding drop in low-treble hardness. This sounds more straightforward than it was because the CS1.6's overall sound changed more during the break-in process than I am used to. Thiel recommends 50 hours 'at moderately loud levels,' but at the end of the month during which I used the Thiels for my everyday listening, I was still not sure that they'd reached equilibrium.  But what had begun as brightness had been transformed into superb resolution of detail. What had started out as a lightweight, not too well-defined low-frequency register ended up as a balance that worked well on such superb double-bass recordings as Edgar Meyer's new disc of concertos, by himself and Bottesini, with the St. Paul Chamber Orchestra (Sony Classical SK 60956). Meyer's Concerto in D starts with some E-string grumbling and portamento slides, all rendered perfectly clearly on the CS1.6s, without any boom obscuring the instrument's pitch.  ",1,0

10,"Ah, the memories..",1,0
10,"In a nutshell: 10/10 - Really good game for being what it is, an old classic.  What is Counter-Strike? - This is basically SWAT team simulator 2000, it's a pretty competitive 5v5 FPS shooter where you must stop the terrorists from a range of objectives, such as rescuing hostages, defusing bombs or killing terrorists before they plant their bomb, even escort missions where you must escort a buddy to a helicopter! As terrorists your goal is to well, kill the Counter-Terrorists, to put it bluntly.  Will it Run on my Computer? - Considering my cheap Lenovo G580 with integrated graphics can handle this at 60fps, unless you use a really outdated PC (like, a computer made before 3D games were commonplace) I'm sure your fine.  Parent's Guide - I'd say FPS games are generally a no-no for parents who care about what their children play, and actually, this game, if you go into settings and turn blood off, its actually not too bad, I'd say 13+ is appropriate.  Graphics - (Note: This game was released in 2000, excuse what is terrible graphics nowadays), pretty good graphics, all the characters are in pretty good detail and the guns look nice and pretty realistic-looking.   Gameplay - I will say, it's quite fun, but I will tell you, this is a game meant to be played with friends or meant to be played with players who are good at teamwork, your entire team could lose simply from one player on your team not going with your team's plans.  Is it Worth The Price? - Yes, absolutely, if you want to see where CS:GO started, get it for sure!",1,0

10,"The classic. The original. The first and last of its kind. The beginning of a legacy. Or just hours upon hours of time wasted while your brain controversially shouts to you 'Just one more round!'  The excitement of a firefight is a standard of most First-Person Shooters but Counter-Strike is different. The game tries to focus on communication and teamwork coincided with skilled aim and complex maneuvers rather than just free-for-all deathmatch game. Failure to comply with the games train of thought winds you up in the lovely thing we gamers call 'Spectator Mode.' Gotta love that! Although becoming proficient at the game will take a lot longer than most games it is worth the time put into it!   Gamers that are looking for a game that requires teamwork, skill, time, practice, and communication will not be disappointed!

10,"Great game! I started with source, and felt that this was going to be a downgrade. After playing for about four minutes, I learned how competitive the game was. I learned I wasn't good at the game, and trained for once. That was something I had never done on Counter-Strike: source.  Now it's time to talk about the bad things: First of all, although there are more servers than TFC has, there is still hardly any servers. You can find a server and join it, but most of the servers have custom maps and free guns. Obviously the graphics are a downgrade, but who plays games for graphics? I sure as hell don't. And for the year 2000 the graphics are great!  There is a misconception with this game where people think that Bunnyhopping is still in the game. It's not. They removed it in 1.4 and it is now 1.6.  Overall, BUY THIS GAME!",1,0

10,"After many years of being out. By far one of my favorite games. I've purchased it many times for myself and friends. Even tho the graphics are shakey. With a decent modern computer and recent HD features this game looks remarkable. The physics in this game are remarkable, relastic and complicated. Its a hard game to get a grasp off, but now that you cannot just spray at ones head and get head shots. This game alongside dota, and starcraft. Were Pioneers in online competitive play and this game should recieve high acolades for its contribution to esports.",1,0

10,"Well I guess since I have 117 hours clocked into this game *cough cough* steam bug *cough cough* I am obligated to write a review for this game. So this game is most definetly timeless as it is basically super smash bros melee to Counter-Strike:Source/Counter-Strike Global Offensive's super smash bros brawl. This game is unique as when you die you don't respawn until the next round meaning that your team can lose by having all of it's members die. As well, you need to buy your weapons or take them from the bodies of your enemies instead of just finding them scattered across the battlefield like other games of it's time did. Today the game can seem a bit outdated with a lack of ragdoll physics making aerial deaths look weird and unnatural as well as the obvious outdated graphics which can be 'fixed' with a hd patch that just looks weird and unnatural compaired to games made at the time of the patch's creation (2003). Overall I would recommend this game if you buy the retail copy or if they fixed the bug that is the only reason why I have logged 117 hours into the game.",1,0

As one of the most popular Half-Life mods to become into a full retail game by Valve, I surely can say this...  Counter-Strike 1.6 started it all.  As an original mod from Valve's game: Half-Life, Counter-Strike grew increasely popular til' this day, spawning updated verisons such as Source &amp; Global Offensive. Even the overly repetitive Call of Duty has been influenced by Counter-Strike, even thou Activision's changed it's view after Modern Warfare 1, but now I'm getting off topic...  In conclusion, there really is no explaination from me to describe this popular game. Counter-Strike's gameplay explains it's self to the community.  10/10.",1,0

This has some maps not found in the source verison and has the riot shield which is not in the source version either. The riot shield allows you to avoid bullets but you cannot have a primary weapon if you have it equiped so you can only use your sidearm. This version also features a gamemode not available in the source version. The gamemode is where you must protect a player controlling a VIP while they make their way to the rescue vehicle. If you want to see how different this is from the source version then go right ahead, it's only $5.00 on steam so you have nothing to lose.",1,0

10,"Gameplay: 10/10 LAN Fun: 3/3  Good Servers: 2/7  Counter-Strike, perhaps the most competitive game of it's time, hasn't aged well graphics-wise, but the gameplay remains more precise and consistent than most FPS games today. This game is a  great  LAN game for get-togethers, but otherwise you may have come too late on perhaps one of the greatest games of all time. Servers that I have connected to show that I have horrible ping, and the lag assures me of that. I have come across a server or two that I can connect to and enjoy, as well as being vanilla-CS, considering all the servers that mainly run modded games (which is about 4/5 of the servers). So here are the reasons to buy the original Counter-Strike:   Pros  -Can run on a potato -Plays smoothly no matter the settings. (However, you can connect to a server somewhere in Latin America or the Middle East, and lag like heck.) -Great fun to play with friends, as it can get really competitive, but at the same time your friends may not have this ancient gem, so this is dependent on the situation. -Solid gameplay. Nothing else really compares to the precision that went into it over the years. -Large map selection, as well as custom-maps found all over the internet. -Mods, but many are not as good as some of the others. You have to dig through garbage to find the fun ones.   Cons  -Very few good servers -Hard to convince people that don't already know how great this game is to buy it, considering it's more than a decade old. -So...many...sound...file...downloads...from...servers... -Custom maps are very rarely as balanced as maps packed in with the game.   Verdict  If you've got the money, and are curious as to what this legendary game is like, then it wouldn't be a complete waste, but if you are coming here from the latest CS or CoD or Battlefield, without having played other older FPS games, then you might regret the buy because this is a game that is quite outdated in terms of UI and such, and might not be appealing.  Overall 7/10 now, after more than a decade since release.",1,0

10,"Probably the best online FPS out there to date. Still a large playerbase after all these years should make it clear.

10,"Counter Strike is a classic game. Fun, addictive, and customizable. It's incredibly easy to mod, texture and map for so you could expect a whole lotta mods.  Pros: -Great gameplay, bit of a learning curve but it'll become second instinct soon enough -Servers are still up, even for such an old game it still has a whole crap-ton of servers.  -Modding community is GREAT -Cheap, as in really freakin cheap, not indie game cheap, but still very cheap Cons -Most people who you will play with have been playing for longer than I have been alive. Expect to get pwned very very often -Netcode is a ♥♥♥♥♥, adjusting settings using the console takes a hell of a while -People are sometimes way too serious when playing -For Graphics junkies: Graphics are pretty damn old-looking (what the hell do you expect it's GoldSrc)  While it's not a perfect game it still provided me with tons of fun and I love playing it. It's a bit slower than CSGO and the weapons behave differently.   Conclusion: If you want a nice classic shooter that's light on the pocket and the computer then this along with Half-Life should be in your library",1,0

You customize your gear then choose to either use tactics to disarm the bomb, or you can JUST RUSH IN LIKE AN INSANE PERSON, GRIP THE HOSTAGES BY THE ARM AS YOU SAY 'FOLLOW ME NOW!!!', and get them to safety. It is pure greatness. And the system requirements are not demanding, so virtualy any computer nowadays can run it.",1,0

10,"This is an interesting game. It is incredibly difficult to rate it either 'yes' or 'no.' There are far too many points to consider. Counter-Strike was released nearly fourteen years ago, yet it is still difficult to find an open server. It is incredibly fun and can make you laugh or tear your hair out. This game can be excellent for fans of strategy games and shooters, but it's very rare to be able to enjoy it fully. Unless you play on competitive servers, most everyone goes 'rogue' and does not work as a team. There are frequent cheaters using programs to increase movement speed, look through walls, or assist in aiming. If you look through the community page, many of the posts are pictures of cats or pornography. When joining a new game, you always feel paranoid about what the server is downloading. The community can be very scary; you must play on servers you trust with people you respect. If you can do this, you will have a blast. Counter-Strike is still played by a huge number of people; you can find great servers with great communities in nearly every language imaginable. There's a wide variety of weapons to choose from, and it is simple to get in on the action. There are no pay-to-win or customization features—only action. Counter-Strike can be a fantastic game if you know how to use it properly.  Things to note: • There are no bots in CS. However, the Counter-Strike: Condition Zero package (probably the best way to purchase the game) includes Condition Zero, which has support for bots and can be played without an Internet connection. • This is not 1.6 (to my knowledge); there are no shields and a few things are different (the difference is negligible). However, Counter-Strike: Condition Zero still has these features. • This is considered a mod for Half-Life. However, it can be downloaded independently. Note that Counter-Strike will be saved inside the 'Half-Life' folder on your computer.",1,0

I can remember so many things about this game like the old PunkBuster anti-hacking program, the transfer from a standalone game to being forced to use Steam to play my Valve titles, the countless hackers using OGC and the amazing community created maps. There are more maps, weapon skins and character skins released for this game than probably any other game ever made. This is truly a classic and will be one of my favorites forever.

10,"This will be more of a ''my experience with this game'' type of review, because saying things like ''great gameplay'' will not suit something I've experienced with Counter-Strike. Here you go:  I remember back in 2002 I was at a friend's house and he was playing a game. I didn't know the name of the game nor I had internet to find it. A few weeks passed by and another friend came over and he didn't have a computer, so he brought a disc with a game in it. He told me that it was one of the best games and from that very moment I knew that it is going to be the game I saw at the other friend's house. When I saw the Counter-Strike logo I was filled with gamegasm (?) and I was so happy. I don't remember a day when I was so happy like back then. So, the journey started. I was playing it hardcore. Made friends, clans, was involved in communities and even made two myself. Counter-Strike is my first game which I played competitively and it was a whole experience. Playing public servers and maybe some servers with mods was very fun, but playing it competitively made it very intense and stressful. In a pleasant way, ofcourse.  Shooters these days try to be different, advanced in a way. Sometimes the most simple games like Counter-Strike are the ones that live to this day. Also, there are plenty of mods to keep your attention to this game. The gameplay is very simple - defend as a Counter-Terrorist, attack as a Terrorist to plant the bomb or save the hostages as a CT. I am sure most of you already know this and I doubt there are gamers that haven't heard or know the gameplay of Counter-Strike, so I am sharing here more of my experience.  I wish I could find my CS Anthology account which I've lost since 2008. So, I decided I am going to buy this game again and here you go - more than a thousand hours played. I still play it from time to time to this day and it brings back many great memories and I sometimes even stumble upon people I've played with years ago. I think Counter-Strike changed gaming in a major way and we wouldn't have many games like we have today, if this game wouldn't exist.  I am sure many of people already have played games like CS:GO, but never the roots. I doubt any of you will play it for more than an hour, because it's much more simple and it differs a lot in my opinion from CS:GO and modern games.  I am glad that I lived through the golden era of shooters and if I'd have to rate it, it'd 10/10 ofcourse,",1,0

10,"This is by far one of the most fun online shooters ever. If not the best ever made, And in my opinion the game that pretty much started the genre. Ive been playing the game off and on since it's release and still to this day it never gets old. The game runs really good on modern pc's and it's really a game that when your doing good you really feel a sense of accomplishment. Plenty of fun maps to play on, plenty of servers to play on, plenty of customization options. This is one game that you can really taylor to suit your style. Plenty of user created skins for your weapons that can really make this game look amazing. And I still prefer counter strike over counter strike source. I don't know, call it nostalgia or whatever but there really is something about just good ol' counter strike 1.6 that is just simply magical. It truley is a classic in every sense of the word. And STILL is just as enjoyable (if not more enjoyable) then any online shooter on the market today. So glad I got to grow up with this game. I would definitley recommend it to any fan of competitive online first person shooters. Come Join the fun.",1,0

This game is absolutely addicting and more original than anything I've ever played. Hell even the user created game modes and maps are great. The maps cs_assault and de_dust 1 and 2 are classics. Every video game developer should look to Counter-Strike as an example when making a multiplayer.

It can be enjoyed anywhere with the 64MB portable version for LAN parties.

10,"Never before has a multiplayer game blended all the elements of true competition and sweat-soaked-shirt anxiety as well a Counter-Strike (CS). You probably already know CS as one of the most popular modifications for Half-Life. It's been available for download for over a year, at least in beta form. But unless you've got a super fast Internet connection at your house, you may not have played it yet as the nearly 100 megabyte download may be daunting for those of you not fortunate enough to have a high-speed connection. Thankfully CS has turned into a full-blown retail game and, while the two versions of CS are identical, it certainly worth shelling out $30 for this stellar title...plus you get a few more multiplayer goodies in the retail package to boot.   Let me start off by saying that the Counter-Strike pack is a stand-alone product. You don't need the original Half-Life to play this game. In the retail package you get a full version of CS as well as Team Fortress Classic, Opposing Force multiplayer, and the Wanted, Redemption and Firearms mods. The entire pack is overflowing with multiplayer fun, but, of course, the real focus of the retail release is Counter-Strike.   There is a single-player component to CS and, while it provides a good primer, this mod is all about online action. You basically play a game of cat and mouse, with the mouse being a terrorist group and the cat a squad of counter-terrorists. As a terrorist, you're goal is to plant a bomb at a specific location or hold a group of hostages. As a counter-terrorist, it's your duty to defuse said bomb or rescue the ill-fated hostages. Taking out all players on the opposing side will also assure your victory.   CS is an action lover's dream, with games lasting only four or five minutes (if that in some cases) because, unlike Half-Life, one shot to the head can mean instant death. CS is the perfect mix between fast-action and realistic damage. You can't just absorb bullet after bullet and expect to walk away. Working as a team is a must and, while you're in the game, taking the lone wolf approach will often get you killed...and fast.   It's the team-based tactics that make CS so fun. I can't stress how important it is in this game to act as a team. If your team is on the defensive side you'll all benefit by creating a cohesive strategy. If you team is on the offensive side, you will all benefit by sticking closely together as well. I'm sure you've seen movies or television show demonstrating this 'Conga Line' style of infiltration. Well, that's exactly how your team will have to act. This creates a fantastic game balance that will keep you coming back for more. It'll also keep you from thinking about your school work, your job, and interaction with your loved ones, and often work around the IGN offices will be put on hold so we can clog our network with CS.   Visually the game will not disappoint. While the Half-Life engine isn't the prettiest beast out there, there is plenty of animation that creates a smooth look and feel, and the gun models are some of the most realistic looking of any shooter available. The environmental textures look realistic enough and complement the provided camouflage well enough for you to be hidden, but not be invisible. As in real life, the distinguishable difference between good guy and bad guy is a little difficult, but the balance to this is if you can't tell who it is then you probably won't be able to hit him with your gun. Now, if you've purchased sniper rifle, you should have plenty of scope magnification to tell the difference between terrorist or counter-terrorist, but otherwise you may be taking out a team member from afar.   As good as it is, a couple of features of this game really stood out as frustrating... at first. But over a period of time they actually became enhancements to online multiplayer gaming. One feature is buying your weapons at the start of each round. This takes a little getting used to at first since, in most shooters, you just run around picking up weapons at your heart's content. Usually by the time you figured out which guns, grenades, and armor you were going to take in your early games, the bad guys would come over and kill you. But a couple of tries later, after getting the gist of things, you're off in no time. The other feature that took some getting used to was the 'wait and watch' feature after you get killed. Once you sustain a lethal injury, you have to wait for the next round to start before you can join in again -- you don't just spawn again and start shooting. This actually adds a ton of anxiety to your efforts of staying alive and completing your objective. But like I mentioned before, the rounds are short, so you shouldn't have to wait too long before you can jump in the action again.   Not surprisingly, the user interface is very Half-Life-esque. Gamers who have played Half-Life or any of the other mods for the game will have no trouble with the menu system. Even for the first time user the interface is easy to use or fumble through. The only thing that even slightly tripped us up in the interface is the 'Update' on the server page. First-time users may be confused into thinking this meant update my version of CS. Not true, it actually means update the list of game servers. But the rest of the interface is easy to understand and even easier to navigate.  Just about the only aspect of this game that we could make negative comments about is the sound. Sure, the realistic guns sounds are spot on, we just wish the same amount of attention to detail was given to the rest of the sound in the game. Some levels have lighting and thunder. When the thunder crashes it sounds a little wimpy. We were hoping for some deeper bass and clearer sounding claps from the lightning. In most of the level the user can go inside or out side of buildings, the sound of their footsteps should also change to reflect what type of surface they are walking on. The sound of footsteps getting closer and closer could also have been improved. As it stands now, it's hard to tell how far down the hallway or street a bad guy is from you by sound alone.  So how long does the magic last? Well we've been playing this game for over a year now and we still can't get enough of it. Are we tired of it? Hell no! We're still surprised by how fun this game is. This game actually made some of us squeal like little school-girls after getting sniped from an unexpected angle on high. On the other hand some of us were drawn to stand up and scream obscenities at the monitor. I guess we'll just have to get them next time!   In a nutshell, if you're looking for the next step in online first person shooters, then look no further. CS is fast paced, intense, and satisfying--this game will not disappoint. This is truly one of the best mods for one of the all time greatest first person shooters ever, and the retail package of CS is simply bursting with multiplayer goodness. If you like to play shooters online, get this pack!",1,0

10,"The best FPS I have ever played. From the original beta versions in 1999 up untill version 1.6 I all love. Some more than others but the basic gameplay is just awesome.  It is highly addictive and frustration levels can rise to highest possible but the fun of teaming up and achieving the kills / goals is just a rush ;) Okay, the graphics are not the greatest anymore, but the fact that after all these years I still pick up the game and play it says enough for me.   http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FiGwvCZ1X0&amp;feature=related   Check it out! :P",1,0

10,"Counter-Strike is one of the most nostalgiac experiences i've had. With that being said I enjoyed the steam version for my 24 hours playing it. However there is a great bit of lag on most servers in this game although I shouldn't have any. Putting that aside however Counter-Strike is still one of the most revolutionary games for its time. The multiplayer may be dying down and I have yet to convert to go which I dont know if I will. If you got this with Half Life you remember getting this with it. This is still the same fun game from that period that has come to be a cult classic. It plays very well and is fun to play with friends. Although I may find Team Fortress 2 more enjoyable from my short time playing that game, I shall still enjoy Counter-Strike for what it was.",1,0

Remember when recoil patterns were easy to understand? Remember when it was possible to take a game seriously and become ridiculously good at it?  The Counter-Strike franchise is very much like Super Smash Bros -- they had Brawl, we had CS:Source and CS:GO. Let's hope VALVe decides to play a proper homage to this game in the future much like Nintendo did with the New Smash Bros.",1,0

10,"Let me start off by saying that the Counter-Strike pack is a stand-alone product. You don't need the original Half-Life to play this game. In the retail package you get a full version of CS as well as Team Fortress Classic, Opposing Force multiplayer, and the Wanted, Redemption and Firearms mods. The entire pack is overflowing with multiplayer fun, but, of course, the real focus of the retail release is Counter-Strike.  There is a single-player component to CS and, while it provides a good primer, this mod is all about online action. You basically play a game of cat and mouse, with the mouse being a terrorist group and the cat a squad of counter-terrorists. As a terrorist, you're goal is to plant a bomb at a specific location or hold a group of hostages. As a counter-terrorist, it's your duty to defuse said bomb or rescue the ill-fated hostages. Taking out all players on the opposing side will also assure your victory.  CS is an action lover's dream, with games lasting only four or five minutes (if that in some cases) because, unlike Half-Life, one shot to the head can mean instant death. CS is the perfect mix between fast-action and realistic damage. You can't just absorb bullet after bullet and expect to walk away. Working as a team is a must and, while you're in the game, taking the lone wolf approach will often get you killed...and fast.  It's the team-based tactics that make CS so fun. I can't stress how important it is in this game to act as a team. If your team is on the defensive side you'll all benefit by creating a cohesive strategy. If you team is on the offensive side, you will all benefit by sticking closely together as well. I'm sure you've seen movies or television show demonstrating this 'Conga Line' style of infiltration. Well, that's exactly how your team will have to act. This creates a fantastic game balance that will keep you coming back for more. It'll also keep you from thinking about your school work, your job, and interaction with your loved ones, and often work around the IGN offices will be put on hold so we can clog our network with CS.  Visually the game will not disappoint. While the Half-Life engine isn't the prettiest beast out there, there is plenty of animation that creates a smooth look and feel, and the gun models are some of the most realistic looking of any shooter available. The environmental textures look realistic enough and complement the provided camouflage well enough for you to be hidden, but not be invisible. As in real life, the distinguishable difference between good guy and bad guy is a little difficult, but the balance to this is if you can't tell who it is then you probably won't be able to hit him with your gun. Now, if you've purchased sniper rifle, you should have plenty of scope magnification to tell the difference between terrorist or counter-terrorist, but otherwise you may be taking out a team member from afar.  As good as it is, a couple of features of this game really stood out as frustrating... at first. But over a period of time they actually became enhancements to online multiplayer gaming. One feature is buying your weapons at the start of each round. This takes a little getting used to at first since, in most shooters, you just run around picking up weapons at your heart's content. Usually by the time you figured out which guns, grenades, and armor you were going to take in your early games, the bad guys would come over and kill you. But a couple of tries later, after getting the gist of things, you're off in no time. The other feature that took some getting used to was the 'wait and watch' feature after you get killed. Once you sustain a lethal injury, you have to wait for the next round to start before you can join in again -- you don't just spawn again and start shooting. This actually adds a ton of anxiety to your efforts of staying alive and completing your objective. But like I mentioned before, the rounds are short, so you shouldn't have to wait too long before you can jump in the action again.  Not surprisingly, the user interface is very Half-Life-esque. Gamers who have played Half-Life or any of the other mods for the game will have no trouble with the menu system. Even for the first time user the interface is easy to use or fumble through. The only thing that even slightly tripped us up in the interface is the 'Update' on the server page. First-time users may be confused into thinking this meant update my version of CS. Not true, it actually means update the list of game servers. But the rest of the interface is easy to understand and even easier to navigate.  Just about the only aspect of this game that we could make negative comments about is the sound. Sure, the realistic guns sounds are spot on, we just wish the same amount of attention to detail was given to the rest of the sound in the game. Some levels have lighting and thunder. When the thunder crashes it sounds a little wimpy. We were hoping for some deeper bass and clearer sounding claps from the lightning. In most of the level the user can go inside or out side of buildings, the sound of their footsteps should also change to reflect what type of surface they are walking on. The sound of footsteps getting closer and closer could also have been improved. As it stands now, it's hard to tell how far down the hallway or street a bad guy is from you by sound alone.  So how long does the magic last? Well we've been playing this game for over a year now and we still can't get enough of it. Are we tired of it? Hell no! We're still surprised by how fun this game is. This game actually made some of us squeal like little school-girls after getting sniped from an unexpected angle on high. On the other hand some of us were drawn to stand up and scream obscenities at the monitor. I guess we'll just have to get them next time!  In a nutshell, if you're looking for the next step in online first person shooters, then look no further. CS is fast paced, intense, and satisfying--this game will not disappoint. This is truly one of the best mods for one of the all time greatest first person shooters ever, and the retail package of CS is simply bursting with multiplayer goodness. If you like to play shooters online, get this pack!",1,0

Then, I started playing on PC and all I played was Minecraft until I downloaded steam and I found Counter Strike.

10,"Counter Strike is an first person shooter that was released in the late 90's.  Whats it about?  Well Counter strike is an online first person shooter where you either play as an terrorist or an counter terrorist.  The terrorists objective is to transport a bomb to a bombsite located on each map marked as (A) or (B). Whilst the counter terrorists main objective is to stop the terrorist force from planting the bomb.  Theres also a gamemode where the terrorists will have hostages and the counter terrorists objective is to rescue the hostages before the time runs out.  Game ends when the counter terrorists has saved all hostages or the terrorists has whiped all counter terrorists.   Is it worth buying?  Since this is an really old game and the graphics are really outdated compared to the games we have today i would still say this game is worth buying.  The game is over 15 years old but still has a alot of active players and playing with friends make it even better.  Counter Strike also has alot of maps, mods and other stuff that makes the game better in any way.

10,"Ignore that my steam account only has 8.7 hours, I've played much longer than that, trust me.  Anyway... Counter-Strike. This game is awesome. I've seen a lot of reviews that say it's dead, but considering the fact that theres about 8,000 people playing at once each day, I can safely say they are wrong. 1.6 is a true competitive shooter, and this (and CZ because they are basically the same) is my favourite and will be known as the best of its series.  Keep this in mind though; this game is HARD. You can't just hop in and kill everyone. No matter if you're some professional CS:GO global elite, if you haven't played this game before, you WILL suck. Deal with it. This game is a lot different to its other titles (Apart from CZ) and when played feels like an almost different game. It's harder than the others and should stay that way.  Only downside is that nobody plays simple server PUGs anymore, so I may have to sign up to ESEA (not free), but it's probably worth it. Remember this game is harder, if you start on this and get good, then you will be even better on GO.   Trust me, if you play 1.6 then go onto CS:GO, it's a breeze.  BUY THIS GAME AND PLAY IT.",1,0

So, i still find CS 1.6 to be the most addictive, but the technical limitations are maddening by today's standards.

10," Counter-Strike:  I started playing cs when I noticed jacking off isn't the only activity to do on a computer.  Sometimes the most simple games like Counter-Strike are the ones that live to this day. The gameplay is very simple - defend as a Counter-Terrorist, attack as a Terrorist to plant the bomb or save the hostages as a CT.  CS is one of the greatest and undermined games in history. It is, in my opinion, the best game to ever have a crosshair. ",1,0

Also almost half! of the servers are filled with annoying germens or russians and the other half either have no one in the server or have ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s as described above.

To tell you the truth i really love this game, it gave me a nice experience and always when i see this game in my inventory im gettin on the feel train.  Nice wars, pub matches, these are good memories, when we had a little group of kids, teenagers, adults, the age did not matter when we were in game.   Sadly that's the past, and a lot of players still playing this game nowadays, but the fact is this game got ruined, no, its not the time and the old graphics, and the new series of counter strike. This happened because the hackers, yes i hate them, i don't know why is it so funny or cool... it's sad.   I'm not going to say Pros and Cons, this game is a collector piece today.

10,"There are 3 games in the Counter-Strike series. There is Counter-Strike Source. Then you have the middle aged brother out of the group, Counter-Strike Condition Zero. Sure these two updated and improved versions are some what good. But the oldest brother is the best. Counter-Strike 1.6. Thought it is the oldest out of all the three, it seems to me that it's the most played and respected game out of them all. I mean sure the other two may be fun. But there is no match up to what the real game. What I mean by this, Counter-Strike 1.6 is the orignal and by far best Counter-Strike ever made. So basically this game may be old but it is the most played and fun out of the three.   Reason being, Counter-Strike 1.6 has the most active and filled Steam Community. The legit and good players of the Counter-Strike series have stayed with the old school. Even though 1.6 may not have as good as graphics as Condition Zero or Counter-Strike Source. It is the most played and talked about around the gaming world. You dont see big gaming websites talking about Condition Zero events. There are no big major Condition Zero events. All of the good and legit players are basically all playing Counter-Strike 1.6. Sure there is some talk about Counter-Strike Source. But non the less, Counter-Strike 1.6 takes some skill to play and become well known as a top notch player. As in Counter-Strike Source there are many messed up things with aim and registration. So really even the slitest baddies can get somewhere with Counter-Strike Source. For as in Counter-Strike 1.6 there is a good amount of skillz needed to play the gama. Atleast to play good.   Soon I hear that a new Counter-Strike is coming into play. Sort of a combination of all three games. Condition-Zero, Counter-Strike Source put some play into it. But see they do not use anything from Counter-Strike 1.6. Theres another good reason why this game is going to be just like Condition-Zero and Counter-Strike Source. Sure people may play the game for a while when its comes out. But all in all Counter-Strike 1.6 is going to be the best Counter-Strike game in the series. Like stated earlier graphics dont matter to me. As well as they dont matter to real gamers. If you play a game cause of it's graphics, then im really sorry to tell you that you are not a real gamer. Its said but true. Games are never about the graphics. Its what the game is and if people enjoy playing it. Sure graphics are sometimes nice. But Counter-Strike 1.6 does not have the greatest graphics in the world and it is one of the most well known and played games in the whole gaming world.",1,0

10,This game is not new player friendly becaus there are only competetive player left in this game or over all hard mods to understand.

Well, I am back, and would of never thought to be in this position. I tried CS:GO, but... eh. The ranks and skins and little kids kind of ruined it for me. Don't get me wrong, it's a great game, but doesn't neccesarily give me the true feeling of Counter Strike. Went back into this game a few years later, and realize the community is filled with nudity, the game has people raging in different laguages, and... hackers.

The game may not be as populated as it once was but there are still plenty of players playing it. The stock maps can be hit or miss to be completely honest as far as gameplay goes, but that's where the age of this game really shines, there is a TON of custom content for this game. Custom maps, custom models, custom weapon skins, custom game modes. I currently play on a server with over 430 custom maps installed!  Most importantly though, the core gameplay of CS stands the test of time. CS:GO might 'feel' a little different to play but it is still built around the core gameplay that you can get right here in 1.6!",1,0

In terms of competition, it set the standard. With immacuately designed maps that are still being used in competitive play 11 years later, there's a reason the game is still played in mass. It's simply a perfect 5 on 5 game. It's nonstop fun, with no ceiling on how good you can become, how far you can make it in N/A leagues such as ESEA. This game is not for those who care about graphics obviously, but simple perfection in game mechanics. You can spend countless hours deathmatching, pubbing, or pugging in ESEA systems. 'Scrimming' is where it's at for me. I can't get enough and I can't seem to stop coming back to this game, even though I've been playing it since beta 5.2. Simply CS is the best, ever. 10/10",1,0

10,"Counter-Strike is one of the only games that I find myself eventually returning to, no matter what other FPS games are out there.   Replayability holds up over the years with the simple concept of tossing players into two teams and giving them an objective:  (as terrorists)  - planting bombs and defending them until it detonates - holding/defending hostages from the CT  (as Counter-Terrorists)  - preventing bombs being planted or defusing them - rescuing hostages  Graphics aren't much to write home about these days, but it's all about the gameplay and weapon behavior. And, definitely, community. Nostalgia may be a large factors for most of us old timers who've been playing for almost two decades. I've made some great friends through this game, almost destroyed my former marriage from my CS addiction xD, and lost track of so much time while playing.

Quick pased and the matches keep moving which will keep you engaged. I'm a 30 year old man reviewing a game I haven't place in 10+ years so just assume it's good. There are newer versions out there but if your PC can only run this, it's still a good time.",1,0

10,"This game Definately hooked me into the CS scene. I personally started in 1.4, but only played at the LAN station. Back then, this game was definately one of my favorites.  If you're coming from the CS:GO Scene to this game, you may feel this game is choppy, and the lack of a large player base leaves you feeling a bit more rubbish: Definately a CS veterans' game. Playing this game will make you realise what Veteran players have felt when they switched from cs1.6 to cs:GO feel with grenade physics, and other minor complaints.",1,0

YOU THINK YOUR ♥♥♥♥ING COMMANDO??? NAH, GET SOME ♥♥♥♥ING SNACKS TO FUEL YOUR COUNTER STRIKE SKILLS  What I usually eat when playing this absolute MIRACLE of a game, are Belize fry jacks.  Here, I'll give you a recipe for fry jacks so you can make your own: Place flour, baking powder, and salt in a bowl. Cut shortening into flour or, if you're using oil, add it to the ingredients. Knead the dough, adding little bits of water at time in order to remove all clumps and create a smooth textured dough. Separate the dough in half and let stand for about 15 minutes.  NICE!!!

10,"This game lies in ruins...  I remember when in the past I used to play this game it used to be a lot more fun. But now, on each and every server you will find atleast 2 cheater using aimbot and wallhack. Also on every server there are always people who are using the non-steam i.e. pirated version of this game. If that's not enough steam is VAC banning the innocents like me. I was playing this game on a deathrun server , barely 7 days from the day I had brought this game. My router went off for a second and when it was back on I saw that I had been VAC banned. Reason : Cheating inflaction. How the hell do you use cheat on a deathrun server ?! And one more thing : The steam guys say that VAC BAN is delayed and takes time , then how the hell did it BAN me in just 31 hours of gameplay ?  Hope this review has helped you in getting a better view of the game.  I have got many games for free from this group :  http://steamcommunity.com/groups/Accidently  . It's an awesome group and I would recommend you to join it if you like to get games for free.",-1,0

10,"If your looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if your looking for an outstanding pie recipe you've come to the right place.  Ingredients: 1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter 2. 1/2 cup white sugar 3. 1/2 cup brown sugar 4. 1/4 cup water 5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon 6. 1 pinch salt 7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced 8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie   Directions: 1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). 2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside. 3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices. 4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal. 5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust. 6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing.",1,1

10,"Counter-Strike, oh Counter-Strike... so, so many hours of playing 1.6 back in high school, getting on the local campus server and playing de_dust, cs_office, de_aztec adn so many more, my first 'modern' FPS. While it has had enhancements of Source and GO, the core CS remains a tight, amazing game with plenty of players. Well-balanced weapons, well-designed maps, no real skill cap, if you need a great multiplayer FPS experience that can run on almost any piece of hardware (I ran this on my Pentium 4 with integrated graphics and 512 MB RAM back in 2004!), then this is for you. My only real complaints is that I do like a single player campaign (though to be fair this is a Half-Life mod), and nowadays you really do need to be excellent to do well!  8.7/10",1,0

The Valve have been very foolish when they pulled CS: GO instead of doing eg CS 1.7 ... and great contests just ... pulled CS 1.6 and CS have shoved GO ... including PGL ( Romanian competition) and now what has become of them now? As I looked a few days now and prizes were ITEM game when the time CS 1.6 were like $ 1000 + products ... Well I think that would gather several clans CS 1.6 ...  A total disaster ... in Romania do not think that there are clans of CS: GO as they were before TeG CS 1.6 and the rest of ... everything is dead ... we are worse than in 1999 on a national / world .. . 0 barred. And do not think that would matter ... eventually I get if I'll do any MILLIONAIRE competitions CS 1.6 ... putty that sign four teams and play VS 'gunmen West' instead of all TeG it's better than playing CS: GO ...,1,0

It has stood the test of time and is the main reason I started playing games on PC. So many hours of de_rats and scoutzknivez that I wouldn't trade for the world.,1,0

Hard game for a beginner because shooting requires a lot of skill but it is very enjoyable moment when you pop a headshot and kill a better player and maybe even win the round with that one. In most of the cases it's pure luck speaking but hey, who cares. At least you made a headshot and had a one round of glory!  Only downside is the server list, which is hijacked and showing fake servers. Use gametracker or other sites like that to see the real servers. Valve should do something to this but it's been going on for years so I guess it's not gonna happen in near future.",1,0

10,"Counter-Strike is a first-person shooter game from Valve, the first of the Counter-Strike series.  Counter-Strike is a round based game where you play as counter terrorist or play as terrorist. As a counter terrorist, your task is to prevent the terrorist from planting a bomb and detonate it or rescue a captured hostages and lead them to the hostage rescue zone, while the terrorist team has to do the opposite. Weapons has hard recoil so you can't just spray and pray, short burst fire can save you in critical situation. Before the round begins, you can and need to buy weapons and equipments with money, you get money by winning the round or killing the enemy team. This type of gameplay encourages team work.

1002,"i joined steam 10 years ago today to play rag doll kung fu, the first 3rd party game on steam.   Amazing fighting game with responsive physics and bullet time slowdowns. Still one of the best and most unique games in my library. The reviews don't do it justice, this game went over most heads due to the difficulty curve and was rightly criticised for being abandoned by Mark Healey when he went on to develop little big planet.   Ignore my playtime, we battered this game before records began  pros-  - deep ragdoll physics creates amazing combat sequences  - weapons, bullet time and magic from your fingertips - awesome game modes  - create your own characters and put them in the game - great music and comedy kung-fu artstyle - original concept   cons-  - hardly any players - steep difficulty curve - the game was abandoned so many promised features never came - the servers are now down (Hamachi or die)   special mention to Ceej, Blupilltaker, Siff, Kitty, Platycus, The Dude, and other forgotten warriors who made this game great  9/10",1,1
1002,"First non-Valve game on Steam. Bought it when it came out, the dedicated MP servers are long gone but it's worth a play co-op, single player or tunngle/hamachi multiplayer.. worth it just for the cutscenes, theme song and style.. p.s. you can edit the theme song too, change the channels, levels, pitch etc.. funky.",1,1
1002,"I played this game when it first came out and let me tell you, it was amazing! You may ask yourself why, and write it off as a simple am gimmicky game. The truth is that this game takes some serious skills and has a lot more depth then you would think. There used to be a small friendly and competitive community back in the day and we would host our own tournements. The reason this game died out is not because it wasn't good, it's because there has always been a problem hosting games and playing with others. You see the developer never added dedicated servers as a feature, therefore we all played through pretty much one or two people who somehow were able to host the game. If this community ever came back to life and dedicated servers were added (or something!) , I would be first in line. Long live RDKF!  10/10  (Siu Mei)",1,1

1002,"Anyone considering getting this game at this point, because the price has come down to 10 bucks... don't. On a functional level, it's not playable. The control scheme is not for most people, and you will cause yourself carpal tunnel syndrome from spinning the mouse in rapid circles while holding a button to charge up. That's if it starts up. And considering it's been abandoned by the creators, there's no bug support if it won't. Beyond the technical issues, the plot and styling of this game is in some of the most poor taste I've ever seen, from fake Chinese speach clearly thought up by white people to blatant homophobia I get the uncomfortable feeling isn't actually joking, it really has all the most reprehensible behavior you'd expect from fratboys. If this crap was done in the guise of joking, it'd be comparable to if a standup comedian delivered a KKK-grade black joke and then spent five minutes yelling 'ISN'T THAT FUNNY!?' at an audience that clearly doesn't agree. If you want a game that's playable or has a well-designed, non-offensive story, this one probably isn't for you. If you have no taste, waste ten bucks and see if it even runs for you. For my money, I'd be better off burning 10 bucks for warmth or literally eating it. It was on sale for $2.50 (I believe 90% off at the time) when I got it and I still want my money back.",-1,1

It minimizes the fun factor. I honestly think they could've built a better game around this ragdoll mechanic. Would I want to see a new or other game with this kind of ragdoll fighting ?

1002,Its almost worth $10 just for the kung fu music mixer on the title screen that you unlock as you beat the game.

1002,"The game is actually good, just not for the price.  I picked this up for three dollars, it came with another game and it was at Dollarama in a physical case. I figured multiplayer on Steam was a thing, since I originally bought a copy for my friend from the same Dollarama and noticed it had steam.  I'm a bit disappointed that it still doesn't exist, same with a lot of features that you'd expect. However, it seems to be ready for multiplayer to be added, as well as the ability to support never-incoming workshop content, since the mods are all really simple reskins.  The game is very simple and fun, and the story is mature, B-movie level garbage, as if Kung Pow: Enter the Fist was directed by Cheech and Chong.   If anyone can find Mr. Healey and get him to mend in workshop and multiplayer or pass the license off to someone willing and capable, it might do a whole hell of a lot better, rather than abandoning it for the PSN version, or even the iTunes comedy doodle version.

However, when the price is 80 US dollars, making it only 10 dollars away from something as powerful as 3D Coat, which does modeling like magic and mixes in sculpting and among other things. It is very very hard to recommend this relic to anyone when for 10, 20 or 30 dollars more you get much much more useful software like Modo Indie or Substance Painter. This was an astounding and flexible piece of software 5 years ago, that’s for sure. Now? It's old, it's buggy and overpriced.",-1,1
100400,"As you can see I've played this game a lot. Unfortunately I'm not sure how one would win this game with over 300 hours played it remains a mystery.   Joking aside Silo 2 is a very competent low poly modeler with fairly easy to use UV unwrap tools.   On the downside its clearly no longer updated or in development (although the company that owns it always denies this despite years of no bug fixes or version changes) so if you do happen upon a bug you will have to learn to work around it.   Generally its cheap entry price and simple approach to low poly modelling is refreshing enough its worth picking up when on sale for sure ; otherwise you might want to check out other options like Blender 3D while complex, with overtly complex UI it is constantly being improved upon and free.",1,1
100400,"Silo 2 is a pretty neat modeler, although unfortunately, nothing else. Still, I find myself really enjoying working in it, as it's a lot easier to use than most commercial software out there. The basic interface is pretty self explanitory, and isn't cluttered with things you won't need, however, you can pretty much customize it to your preference, so migrating from other software won't make you feel that out of place. I've used the demo first, for 30 days, and only had 1 crash happen, so far, It has been pretty stable for me.   If you want to buy this, try it out first, as some people don't seem to like it (but that's pretty common with everything anyways). You have to keep in mind, that everyone's preferences are different, so you have to find the right tool for you. There's a similar software called Voidworld, which is free, and was practically created to be a replacement for Silo, you can try that too and make comparrisons yourself. However, it's not as optimized, so it eats quite a lot of your resources, and might not run as good on your computer as on anyone elses (I practically couldn't use it, because it kept crashing, but I have a crappy laptop).   If you're looking for other, similar commercial software, you can also give Hexagon 2.5 a go (from Daz3D). It can do pretty much the same thing, with the addition of directly painting onto models, althought not as good in that field as 3D-Coat, as some parts of the UV need tweaking before you can begin painting (if you don't want to have streched textures on certain verticles). Unfortunately, that too, like Silo, is not being updated anymore. Still, don't let the lack of updates discourage you from software if you enjoy working with them. At the end of the day, it's all about what you like, and how you can utilize your tool anyways.  Also, If you're new to 3D modeling, make sure that you understand the basics. These are universal, and not exclusive to any kind of application. If you don't know your foundations, you might feel uncomfortable and let down, after a few failed attemps at translating your thoughts into a model.",1,1
100400,"Pro:  Good program for beginers and industry standards also used in Digital Tutors as one of the best easy and fast modeling programs out there, UI is clean and solid , the performance is great  Con:  Modeling Tool only, Poor coding within the program its self, the program is very hardware dependant and also crashes when any model is at 1mil polycount so be warned when modeling in this program, program is no longer supported | abandoned from the company  Overal:  Apart from the crashing when you hit 1mil polycount, this program is a decent modeling tool for the price its at, with all the others being extremly high cost. the program is good for people wanting to start in the industry for beginers or for artists wanting to freelance or sell there models online.  Important Side Note: because its no longer supported | abandoned there is no support for it if you have any issues. (excluding the 1mil poly count crash)  Side Note: If you cant afford to buy any 3d software there are 2 free to use alternatives to get you started which are Blender Sculptris you will need to research if there only for personal, commercial use or both  15,07,2014 Update I was surprised yesterday on the 14th, I noticed a update from silo 2 -  v2.3 that was posted on july 2nd  Note: This update focuses mostly on Silo for Linux (our most-requested update), plus small bug fixes and internal optimizations that should benefit all users. We've also added .stl import and an updated windowing system. Much of this update is internal code optimization to pave the way for future updates. (So even though we've added support for a whole new operating system, we've kept the version increase small--just 2.2 to 2.3.)  source:  https://www.facebook.com/Silo3D   only took them over a year to release a update",1,0
100400,"I bought Silo back when it was only $80 and during a 40% off sale so I didn't spend much. But now the full price is $119.99 without any real updates - WTF?!? For the price and considering Silo is abandonware I simply cannot recommend Silo. Instead I'd recommend Blender (free) or Modo Indie (cheap).  I originally purchased Silo for at home modeling. Although experienced and trained in 3ds Max and Maya those are just too expensive. I had also first tried Blender but was so put off by the user interface that I ended up buying Silo. This turned out to be a mistake because I ended up revisiting Blender went thru some free tutorials on cgcookie website and Blender became easier to use. Blender might take longer to learn but the reward is that it is more powerful and faster to work with once you learn it.  Right now I have over 50 hours in Modo Indie. Modo is the best modeling software I have ever used. Ever. Better than 3ds Max and that is saying a lot because I love 3ds Max. Modo Indie's Meshfusion and Procedural Modeling is simply amazing - look on youtube for demonstrations. Modeling in Modo is 20 times better and 5 to 10 times faster than working in Silo. Modo Indie is available at low monthly subscription cost or full license. The full price of Modo indie is $299 and if you compare price and features to Silo it's a no brainer. With Modo you are getting not only better modeling and uv tools - you can also texture, sculpt, animate and render with a high quality ray traced renderer. And to top it off Modo has an awesome user interface. (If you want to purchase a full license for Modo wait for a sale.)  I'd only recommend Silo if it were free especially since the developer is putting zero time into it. Both Blender and Modo are actively being developed.",-1,0
100400,"Silo is a modeling package that is designed to do modeling and nothing else. By focusing on just modeling however, it's able to make itself into an intuitive tool used for quick modeling and UV mapping.   The interface has some very smart, intuitive features (hitting a hotkey combo while hovering over a menu option will assign that hotkey to the menu option for example) that make using the program quick and easy.  With it being a smaller program with less community than, say Maya, 3ds Max, or even Blender, finding help on line for modeling beginners or Silo newcomers can be troublesome. Other issues include the fact that it can be fairly easy to crash the program if you're not careful.  However the ease of use the program brings to the table, not to mention it's incredibly fair price make it a program to look into if you're in the market for a affordable helpful modeling program.",1,1
100400,"Silo 2 is a fairly decent program warned the lines of beginners than anything, however they may find a number of things to hold the lack of tutorials and support, overall it is a decent model program for its price.",-1,0
100400,"A lot of people give this software flak about what it is and what it does. But I'm here to clarify what this software is all about. It's an excellent modeling software with great and easy to use user interfaces from everything to UV mapping to basic sculpting. Does it crash, yes; but only sometimes and it also depends on how much your system can handle and how much your pushing the software. It's crashed on me while sculpting but only because I pushed it to it's extremes (which I said before, it's only ment for the basics when it comes to sculpting). But, when it comes to modeling for literally anything; the imagination behind it is the limit. I've used this software for practically everything during my associates degree in 3d modeling and animation for college assignments and it has been flawless for me (and I'm still using it to this very day and still have no complaints). You will also see that a lot of people argue that it needs updates. I would have to agree but, if they were to update it; it would have to be a very large one. For, their isn't really much to update. All in all, it's a great software and well worth the money in my opinion and recommend it to anyone interested or even already in 3d modeling.",1,1
100400,"Easy to use and user friendly 3D modeling program with an amazingly simple interface. Silo is glitchy as hell its a good program to learn in. You'll have to find something else for texturing though, the UV mapping tool in this is pretty much broken.",1,0
100400,"Silo is not the best tool on the market, but any experienced 3D artist will agree that there is no equivalent to a 'panacea' in the 3D-modeling fields. Silo is a focused polygonal modeling tool with some limited sculting capabilities and that pretty much covers it. It has UV-unwrapping functionality as well, but it is painfully inadequate and very difficult to work with.  Silo's primary strength lies in its user friendliness and how simple, fast and reliable you can build a high-quality mesh of either a lowpoly or highpoly nature. Creating a character mesh by manipulating Silo's great subdivision functions and adding details with the paint displacement tool is nothing new that you would not be able to do in 3DS Max or Blender, but it is the ease of doing so in Silo that sets it apart from its competitors.  This tool is not for everyone and I recommend trying it before you buy it.",1,0
100400,"Easy interface, low level of crashes (for me), very fun to use. But the price is a bit high! It shouldn't be about $70 bucks honestly, it should be what I paid for on a sale, $40.

If you don't have money / don't want to spend money you can also check Blender (free modeling and animating tool) which offers more, but is harder to learn.",1,0

100400,"Silo 2 is a great program if you have more than a beginner level of understanding when it comes to modeling. I've only used it for a few things but from what I can see the program has a lot of good tools and simple UV unwrapping. When it comes down to it and you are looking for a cheap lightweight modeling program, this is something you may want to consider. I would say that Silo is more for advanced users, the documentation is kind of lacking and there haven't been any updates to it for quite some time. The sculpting part of it is a little weird, I would not recommend this if you're wanting to sculpt something. I would look into tools that contain dedicated systems for this such as ZBrush, Mudbox, or the most common free tool, Blender. All in all, this is a great piece of software if you're willing to learn most of Silo through trial and error.",1,1

You can save all your preferences to a backup, which is quite valuable but underrated feature. Autosave works nicely (which is good, cause Silo2 crashes on me sometimes doing boolean operations).

100400,Tidiest Modeler I've played with so far. Not many bells and whistles however ( I don't think you can even paint outside of just using brushes for sculpting).  Silo has a very clean and polished interface making it easy to see what you're working with more so than other modeling suites and anyone with basic knowedge should be able to find their way around easy enough.  Random instabiliiy issues on machines not running 64 bit Win ~ Silo 2 was not practical for me until I upgraded even considering it's adjustable autosave feature.  Fun to play in and useful for creating rough basic shapes. Beyond that I trust the exported Obj files to the (still) free Sculptris or Curvy 3D.,1,0

10090,"World at War is a masterpiece and a damn good game. The gameplay is simply COD4 with a different era.   http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=359464240  Its fun, fast, and arcadie. In terms of singleplayer, this installment saw you brave the horrors of WWII from both a Russian and American perspective; battling the Japanesse on Iwo Jima   http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=358229015  and beating down the 3rd Reich from Stalingrad to Berlin. Featuring the voice talents of Keifer Sutherland for the American Sgt. Roebuck, and Gary Oldman for the premier of the legendary hard-as-nails Russian sniper - Viktor Reznov. The campaign is both compelling and fantasicaly written with mixes of close and ranged combat along a spectrum of locales beautifully designed and planned. The singleplayer is, as far as im concerned, unsurpassable by any other 'Call of Duty' game.   Multiplayer is still alive and active. The servers are very fun to play in and have a lot of active players on them. WaW's multiplayer is very fun and solid. It may have a couple of cheap moments like any other COD has.

10090,"When Infinity Ward released Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare back in 2007, the developer was met with critical acclaim and praise for breaking away from the World War II setting that had started to bog down the once revolutionary series. That made Treyarch's decision to bring the fifth installment back to the historical time period that much more confusing - why mess with success? Well, Call of Duty: World at War returns to the series' roots, and is a good reminder of why World War II games became so popular in the first place - the tone is gritty, the pace is frantic, and the action is visceral.  World at War's story is split between two very different fronts - the ferocious jungle campaign of the Pacific theatre, and the retaliatory invasion of the Russians on the Eastern front. That's right - no pesky Normandy invasions this time around! In the Pacific, you take on the role of Private Miller of the United States Marine Corps, and take part in the island hopping campaign towards Okinawa. On the Eastern Front, you play as Private Dimitri Petrenko, and are tasked with pushing the Nazis out of Russia and marching into Berlin. The campaign is paced exceptionally well so that after a few missions of fighting as Miller in the Pacific, you'll switch over to play as Dimitri in Eastern Europe. This stops the campaign from becoming stale, keeping it fresh and exciting.  Perhaps the best part of the campaign is the sheer amount of variety found in the missions. The first mission as Private Petrenko, for example, comes straight out of the movie Enemy at the Gates. Narrowly surviving a massacre in Nazi controlled Stalingrad, you and an injured comrade have to make your way through the enemy filled streets armed with only a sniper rifle in order to assassinate the German General. In addition to sniper duels, you'll also have to burn out enemy fortifications during the campaign, as well as command a tank through enemy infested Germany.  One of the most memorable missions has you playing as neither Miller nor Petrenko, but Petty Officer Locke, a gunner for a PBY Catalina flying boat. In addition to shooting down Japanese patrol boats, merchant ships, and fighter planes, you'll have to try and rescue American sailors stranded in the sea after their fleet is decimated by a squadron of kamikaze fighters. The mission is really unique, and the intensity ramps up significantly as more Japanese planes show up, and ammo starts becoming scarce. The first person views of the plane's interior as well as the exceptional dialogue make this mission much more than a standard rail shooting experience.  Although it is overall an invigorating experience, the campaign does have a few faults - most notably, some annoying glitches. For example, in order to finish one mission, you have to regroup with your squad. The mission won't end, however, until you backtrack half way through the level and unstick one of your AI buddies with a grenade - something that obviously shouldn't make into the finished product. There are a few other minor glitches as well, such as the little grenade symbol by your feet sometimes staying on screen long after its explosion, but these usually don't have an effect on the gameplay, and are thus easily ignorable.  As great as the campaign is alone, it's even greater with a few friends. World at War allows you to play through the entire campaign with up to three friends, and you can even turn on competitive scoring, much like in Halo 3, to add a new layer of depth when playing with friends. The other co-operative mode in World at War is the ever-addictive Nazi Zombies. With a few friends, you get to fight off a never-ending horde of Nazi Zombies, starting off with just a pistol. As the game continues, and the waves get progressively harder and harder, new guns are available to purchase. It's hectic and crazy, and although no Left 4 Dead, it is a heck of a lot of fun.   If Nazi Zombies isn't your thing, then you might find World at War's multiplayer more enjoyable. Treyarch took the super addictive multiplayer system from Modern Warfare, and it still is great. Classes, perks, prestige classes - it's all here. Of course, some of the technology present in Call of Duty 4 wasn't around back in the 1940's, so Treyarch did have to make a few, slight changes. For example, instead of being able to call in Helicopters after getting a killing streak, you can bring in attack dogs to attack your foes, or call in artillery strikes to bombard enemy positions. The essentials are all the same however. You get experience points for killing enemies and winning matches, which can be used to unlock new, powerful guns, weapon accessories and armor, and better perks. The prestige class returns as well, allowing you to return to level 1 after reaching the maximum level. You can do this up to 10 times, so if you are dedicated in getting to the top, be prepared to put a lot of hours in World at War.   The graphics in World at War are stunning, with dazzling explosions lighting up the screen and individual character models looking impressively detailed, especially up close, such as when a Banzai soldier jumps on you with a bayonet in your face. The animations are spectacular as well, with no two soldiers dying the same way. You can even blow off individual body parts off with certain weapons, like the shotgun, which is of course extremely satisfying. The game's audio also stands up extremely well. The game features big name voice talent such as Kiefer Sutherland and Gary Oldman, and the soundtrack is immersive and fitting. The guns sound realistic and appropriately powerful - you can even hear the sounds of sizzling flesh after burning enemies with the flamethrower. If that sound doesn't draw you into the war, I'm not sure if anything will.  In the end, Call of Duty: World at War is a bit of an odd duck. It combines the new, successful multiplayer system of Modern Warfare with the old, familiar setting of World War II. Though WWII games are a dime a dozen, Call of Duty is still at the top for a reason. The campaign is varied and exciting, and can be played with up to three friends. The multiplayer is deep and addictive, and the new Nazi Zombie mode is surprisingly entertaining. The only major obstacle to enjoying this game for some is probably the setting. If you're absolutely sick of World War II, then you might end up forcing yourself not to enjoy this game. However, if you're a fan of first person shooters in the least, then World at War will provide an enthralling experience.",1,1

Sorry, it's not that I don't like making friends, but i'd rather met people a better way than just that, thanks guys.",1,1

One more thing, do you know what is better than killing Nazi and zombies? KILLING NAZI ZOMBIES!!!!!!!",1,1
10090,"If you can pick it up during a sale, its definitely worth it just for zombies alone. the campaign is decent, but the last mission (veteran difficulty) is rediculous, how did the german army lose if they had that many grenades?

10090,"Call of Duty: World at War is by far one of the best FPS co-op games on steam. Why? Not only does it have an entertaining fast paced still active multiplayer and an extremely involved campaign, but World at War also comes with modding capabilities. Many WaW fans agree, one of the best parts of Call of Duty is its zombies! Within the zombie mode, modders and mappers have introduced custom zombies maps for you to download online. This way you aren't stuck playing the same 4 zombie maps. There are hundreds of custom maps featuring customized weapons, camos, perks, scenery, storylines, objectives, game modes, and much more! Would definitely recommend this game to any FPS zombie lover out there. A+ in my book!   Download Custom Zombies Maps Here:   http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=484657357 ",1,1
10090,Pros - Not set in space - No boost jumping - No exo suits - No Micro-transactions - No 12 year old squekers or Ali-A fanboys screaming down the mic - All DLC is included with the game for FREE - Custom zombie maps  - The campaign is awesome - 64 player servers - You can drive tanks for ♥♥♥♥s sake - Still fun to play after being released 8 years ago   Cons - Made by the same company who made Black Ops 3 - Martyrdom and Last stand perks ,1,1
10090,"The second best Call of Duty ever made and one of the last good remaining ones. Call of Duty: World at War is not a masterpiece but it is a damn good game. The gameplay is simply COD4 with a different era. Its fun, fast, and arcadie. The single player is alright with a couple of interesting characters. Nothing worth praising here but a lot of enjoyment is to be had from the campaing.  Multiplayer is still alive and active. The servers are very fun to play in and have a lot of active players on them. WaW's multiplayer is very fun and solid. It may have a couple of cheap moments like any other COD has. But it is still very enjoyable and can keep you entertained for a couple of hours.  As always I leave the best for last. Zombies! Call of Duty: World at War's zombie mode is one of the best co-op experiences I have ever had. Its fun, gameplay is solid, theres a story, and it will give you and your friends hours upon hours of entertainment. The game comes with 4 solid maps to play on. Natch Der Untoten, Verruckt, Shi No Numa, and Der Riese. These maps offer great variety and are very fun to play in. Zombies is the biggest and most alive part of this game. With a community that has created thousands upon thousands of custom zombie maps that one can enjoy. Many map makers like ZCT and TMG provide high quality maps that can be compared to Treyarch's best.   You still reading eh? Go and buy this game NOW! Yeah thats right, NOW! This is a game everyone should have in their libraries as it offers many hours of entertainment. Like stated before this is the 2nd best Call of Duty to be made. I give this game a 9.5/10 as it truly deserves that score.",1,0

10090,"I have a story to tell, might get nostalgic to some of you so sit down and grab a drink. Back in 2009, i was at my cousins house playing out in the yard, then his bigger brother left his room to go walking with the older cousins, leaving just me, my cousin(we'll call cathal) and my other cousin Aaron. Now we went in his room and found his Xbox 360 and a so we turned it on. The game inside, Call of Duty: World at War. We decided to play and when we got on, we choose multiplayer and played with the split screen mode ond choose one of my favourite maps, Castle. We would camp at the two main buildings snipping with the PTRS-41 and using the other pre-made classes. After we played for a few hours, his brother came back and we left to go back outside. I went home asking my dad if i can get this game call Call of duty. HE said sure. Ever since that day, my life was consumed by first person shooters. I got it for the Wii btw. Each day i would go onto My wii and play WAW. Then i got an Xbox 360 and Xbox live. THats when i met people from around Ireland or the UK (i live in Australia now). I would play Multiplayer for hours, Zombies for hours, replay that mission where istill will never figure out how to shot Amirch Hamsel with a pistol from that range like wtf. Tehn i got the MW series, Black ops which i loved just as much and Halo Games which came with the 360. Now, 7 years later, im 16. I play Counter Strike and other games on my 360. However, every so often, ill boot up WAW, MW, BO, to relive distant memories. Remembering all my friends who i would add to platy COD with, Friends who i miss so much, Friends who ill never talk to again. But in the end, Call of Duty is an old classic you boot up on a Saturday evening to play with friends, have a laugh to escape life drama. Ill miss the old days, Split Screening, The PPSH-41, The sense of the Japense charging with a BANZAI. The fall of that german soilder on top of the reighstag, the sense of sniping 7 soilders and a dog with 5 bullets. Ill miss COD back in the late 2000s and early 2010s. I love this game 10/10 :')",1,1

10090,"Welcome to my review for call of duty world at war.  Overview: call of duty world at war is a great call of duty game and extremly fun. While everyone says its a copy and paste of cod 4 its a good one and i'm glad treyarch made a ww2 version of cod 4 because the ww2 cods were great. If your wondering where all the dlc is its included in the game and its a good price for the base game and all 4 map packs.  Campaign: The campaign is really cool and it proves the struggle that the russians had during the germans rise to power. Its one of those games that are so gorey that it makes you grateful that you didnt have to go to war and it makes you apreciate the army's work, for example you shoot someone in the arm and it will fly off and blood will splatter everywhere, shoot someone in the head with a shotgun and the enemys head will fly off, shoot someone in the leg and both legs will fly off. The story is great, you play as 2 different characters in the campaign: Dimitri petrenko (russian) &amp; private C miller, On the American side you play as private C miller and you escape torture and raid the japanese camp that you escape from and continue to fight the war. It leads you through a long war that will keep you going for ages. For example on mission 2 theres an easter egg that lets you have a ray gun and mission 3 you get a flamethrower and another badass american mission is when you play as a commander on a ww2 plane and you feel like your raining death (a bit like death from above from cod 4, as i said this is a ww2 version of cod 4). The russian side where you play as dimitri is probably the best part of the campaign because it has the more badass missions. You start off by being in the middle of a massacre at a town square only to meet sergeant reznov who helps you avange the massacre. You continue the campaign trying to regain control of the reichstag (end 2 missions of the campaign) but through that journey you murder as many germans as you can, you even go to their homeland and murder them there. Theres also a russian mission where you drive a tank as means of transport. The ending of the Russian campaign (end of campaign acctually) is badass and im not going to spoil it, just youtube it or play the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ game.  Overall i think the campaign is great and worth the price inculded in the game, i rate is 8/10  Multiplayer: I dont really play much of this, probably a quarter of my hours but i stopped playing because of how many hackers are in multiplayer. Just like cod 4 you have 5 create-a-class slots with a primary weapon and 1 attachment, a secondary weapon, an equipment slot, 3 perk slots and a vehicle slot (yes some maps you can drive a tank). There is a great gamemode called war where theres a flag you have to capture and the more kills you get the faster you can capture a flag, im not going into to much detail because thats pretty much all war is. The maps are surprisingly really fun and i really enjoy them.  Overall i give the multiplayer 7/10 because of the hackers, if there wasnt hackers i would give 8/10  Zombies: This is probably my most played part and it is because of custom zombies. Custom zombies is really fun and the people out there create some amazing maps maybe even better than treyarchs default map. I wouldn't suggest playing co-op zombies unless your playing with a friend because people will steal your window and you get people on the mic but if you play solo or with a friend you save yourself from the migraines. The 4 default zombies maps are included (nacht der toten, verruckt, shi no numa &amp; der reise) and they has some really nice features (shame that only der reise has pack a punch). There are 4 perks in zombies to which is very obvious (quick revive, speedcola, juggernog and double tap). Quick revive is a self revive on solo which means when you down you can get back up but you only have 3 uses, juggernog increases your health from 2 hits to die to 4-5 hits to die, speedcola makes you reload double fast and double tap lets you shoot 2x as fast. The guns are good but not amazing unless you have the ray gun or unless your on der reise and can pack a punch (pack a punch gives you a cool camo and shooting sound and doubles, qtriples or quadruples your gun damage, not sure which).  Overall i think zombies is the best part, I wouldn't mind paying £20 for the zombies on its own but I rate the zombies part 9.5/10.  One last note: If anyone does buy the game or enjoyed the review please thumbs up as this is the first review I have spent very long on but if you do get the game please send me a friend request, I'm always looking for friends on zombies but anyways buy the game and I promise you will love it.

10090,"I have a deep hatred of Call of Duty (for a wide array of reasons), but this game on the PC kind of passed my firewall.  In terms of system requirements and gameplay fluency, I was beyond surprised with how well this game runs. I was running a full 60 FPS flawless, even on the higher-paced Zombies mod, which honestly is the only saving grace in Call of Duty.  The singleplayer was pretty interesting, too; it was a cool campaign of WWII taking place on two fronts against two highly different enemies - the Japanese favor unconventional, barbaric and suicidal attacks which provide challenge for the close-quarters-oriented United States Marines, and Hitler's Angels go against the Soviets in a longer-ranged conflict.  The weaponry feels so unique and abstract from other installments of this otherwise putrid franchise, though that primarily comes from the gore effects in this game. Watching enemies' limbs go flying off when I blast them off with a pump-action shotgun reminds me of many years ago when I played this game on the Xbox 360.  So World at War provides an entertaining singleplayer, which also has the equivalent of Halo's 'skulls' (difficulty and game modifiers that provide either more challenging or easier effects in the gameplay) and cooperative campaign gameplay (it did on the Xbox, at least; I'm almost positive it does on the PC), and the Zombies mode is at its strongest and purest roots. It's tragic when the series' (Zombies) origins are the best version of it.  Oh, and it's World War II, not this futuristic Titanfall wannabe ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. (One of my many reasons for loathing CoD.)",1,1

10090,"Call of Duty: World at War is the fifth game in the COD franchise, releasing in 2008 on PC, PS3, PS2, Wii and Xbox 360. The game was developed by Treyarch and published by Activision. This game is set in the World War II era where you play as various soldiers from United States and The Red Army. Please note that this review is purely based on the single player aspect of World at War.   The gameplay shares several features with the rest of the COD franchise up to this release. You spend the majority of the time with at least one other AI controlled squad member which guide you through levels and keeps you up to date with your current objective. You may only carry two weapons at any one time, whilst also having access to smoke grenades, Molotov’s and hand grenades. We have all of the standard FPS mechanics like crouching and prone positions. You recover health by staying out of line of fire of enemies, since there is no “health” packs throughout the game. You know when you are getting close to death as the edges of your screen glow red and your heartbeat increases. I personally think this is a nice feature rather than relying on a health bar, it adds to the immersion of the gameplay as the UI is very minimal.   Since this game was released almost eight years ago, the graphics are certainly starting to show their age, with some really low res textures, but the environments are all still really nicely designed, animations on everything is stellar too. Character models are all high quality too. The game’s sound effects are brilliant too; you really feel like you are under heavy fire from enemies when you have surround sound on with a sub. The fully voice acted characters are also very well done too.   This is one of the few COD games which I had a few moments of difficulty throughout the campaign. Usually with COD games your AI partners are able to carry you through most levels with little interaction from you needed, however this game is different. The tank missions are the ones I found to be the most difficult as you really need eyes in the back of your head in order to avoid taking damage from the hundreds of enemies that have you in their sights. I am not condemning the game for difficulty; it is really refreshing to see a COD game has the challenge in it. The more recent COD games have become a walk in the park so it was nice to see something different here.   Whilst the game is linear, there are a few collectables to find throughout the single player campaign, there are 13 “death cards” to be found on every level which unlock cheat modes when playing in co-op. This again is a really cool feature and gives you some incentive to check every room, nook and cranny to find the collectables rather than a pointless achievement.   The only negative point about this game for me is the game’s length. I realise I only played the single player so I am only getting half of the experience, but I would have liked to have seen at least five hour single player campaign mode. I managed to complete the game on a medium difficulty in just over three hours. You could replay the game to go back and find all of the collectables and you could also ramp up the difficulty, but given the linearity of the game I don’t see myself jumping into doing that anytime soon. Looking at the Steam chart numbers, the multiplayer scene is really active still so if multiplayer is your jam you will find a match quite easily still.   Technically I only had one issue, and that is with the graphics on some levels. It almost felt like my graphics card was dying as there was spewing graphics all over my screen at some point. It is hard to explain how they looked, but they were really off putting to the game and only happened every few levels. A simple re-load resolved the issue thankfully.   Call of Duty: World at War is one of the best games in the COD franchise and one that still holds its own in the current generation of games. Due to the single player’s length, the price point on this game is quite high at £19,99. I would say that if you plan on getting into the multiplayer side of this game, you should pick it up for that price, however if you are only interested in the single player campaign mode, you would be better off waiting for it to go on sale, unfortunately reduction on COD games are very rare so you need to keep your eyes peeled for the deals!   For anyone who has just skipped a head to my rating; I will repeat, this game was reviewed purely on the single player campaign; please bear that in mind with this rating.      Tom's Score Card   1) Stay away 2) Not Recommended   3) Only recommended when on sale   4) Recommended 5) Highly recommended 6) This is a must play  If you found this review helpful, please give it a thumbs up.

After reading some reviews and watching some videos etc. I decided to get it and hell was it worth it. The campaign is short but a blast. You still are a badass but atleast you have to take cover and I ended up dying a ton of times on regular difficulty. The mulitplayer has a surprisingly decent amount of players playing it and on the right servers you will always be able to find a game and boy is it fun. Zombies is also very fun and I would reccomend getting it with your friends for a real good time, because usually you'll have to wait awhile to find a zombie match. Just all together this game ( atleast the campaign, and dont get me started on how amazing the seige on berlin is ) actually feels like a war and is a really good FPS.

Let me explain why, the campaign is so much fun, Intresting and replayable because this campaign has so many great missions. Next the Multiplayer... To date the Multiplayer is amazing but nowadays there are a few Hackers who just ruin it, but its very little that I see them in a game and there are some Higher XP lobbies which will get you ranked up quickly if you are new to the game so you can get the good guns such as the MP-40, Thompson and My fav weapon in the game the Springfield plus the MP maps are just amazing and have been remade becuase they where just to great. And then there is zombies a gamemode that was nearly canceled (which would have been a massive mistake) the zombies maps are my favs out of the Treyarch games and are the most fun to play and with people making modded zombie maps the fun can keep going. But zombies is very very fun if you have not played a Cod Treyarch game then I reccomend this one first to see how amazing cod really was. Thanks for reading :)",1,1

10090," Introduction:  Call of Duty World at War developed by Treyarch is now a beloved classic in the eye's of many Call of Duty enthusiasts and still incredibly sought after by PC gamers to this day.    Overview:  Developed by Treyarch Call of Duty World at War remains amongst the top of many PC Call of Duty fans wishlists and standard playlists years after release for many reasons. True to the series fluid arcade style FPS gameplay elements fueled by adrenaline and a constant gameplay flow. Call of Duty: World at War separates itself from the pack as the last true Call of Duty PC release.   With graphics optimization unheard of in this day and age of COD console ports to a modding friendly PC release, whether it be it's first forray in into Treyarchs now trademark Zombie mode or a multitude of community driven content in all aspects of multiplayer. Call of Duty: World at War is seen as the last title in the series to be given the full PC treatment gamers grew used to and has sadly never returned.   Fans of the series who have never experienced Call of Duty: World at War will be amazed at the amount of content available as a standard retail release. The PC Steam version of this title comes preloaded with the DLC preinstalled for $19.99 which, is why this title has never seen a price drop aside from activisions penchant for never letting their financial steely grip on price reductions slip through their fingers and benefit the consumer on the backend. I must reiterate this Call of Duty release simply doesn't need one. With all the content available in this iteration anyone considering a purchase will be more than pleased with their decision to opt in to the lesser known older brother of the Black Ops series.   Graphics:  8.5  Just as any other version of the generation 7 Call of Duty games this is also based on the 2007 Unreal engine which, means considering the amount of graphics optimization available Call of Duty: World at War in comparison to it's younger siblings still holds it's own in many aspects and more in some cases.    Gameplay:  8.0  Although not quite as intricate as Infinity Wards fan favorite Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare. World at War holds it's own where it matters.....Solid gameplay. This is a tried and true Call of Duty recipe since the originals release which I am happy to say is represented perfectly. Although a bit on the no frills side in comparison to Modern Warfare, some prefer it's tenacious gun battles and old school FPS precision beats killstreak style and should in the least be embraced by all 'New school' Call of Duty fans.    Sound:  8.5   A series staple. Call of Duty doesn't let down even by current generation 8 standards. Every whizzing bullet and explosion will test even the most high end of Dolby Surroud Sound systems subwoofers currently on the market today. When the settings are placed just right, you can close your eyes and imagine what an existance in this chaotic time in history would have been like. This truley helps set the tone in any true battlefield experience and World at War doesn't dissapoint.    Online experience:  9.0  After all these years Call of Duty: World at War still has a thriving online vs. multiplayer community supplimented by a vast zombies experience that many consider to be superior to the franchises later releases. Due solely to the dedicated modding community that activision has sadly all but forgotten about in it's later releases. With that being said the multiplayer servers are also maintained by groups of dedicated FPS communities. One specific group that must be mentioned for it's servers integrity and organization is the [PDE] ' PerfectDarkElite', this groups primary servers are maintained by some of the most friendly and integrity driven individuals that I can proudly say I have played along side for countless hours of intense online battles.    Story:  7.5  The story of Call of Duty: World at War is what I would consider it's weakest point. Seeded in the standard World War II scenario, you won't find much originality here. Yet with that being said it still manages to keep your interest as any Call of Duty action fest should with the series standard over exaggerated explosions and barely made it through situations, World at War still has it moments of surprize and awe.    Replay Value:  10  With all the above mentioned features preinstalled in the retail release and available from the online community this is where Call of Duty: World at War shines above the rest!!! If your looking to make a Call of Duty purchase that will last into future if the past is any example then World at War is it! With a lower price tag than it's younger brothers, every dollar is a dollar well spent. The replay value of this title is endless.     Final Review Score:  8.0  There are two defining Call of Duty titles from the seventh generation that not only set the standard for all titles to come in the series but, also simply couldn't be matched in terms of gripping single player campaigns to this day Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare and World at War. Without a doubt Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare is the superior of the two but, regardless there's a reason that Treyarch continued to base multiple entries on the gameplay formula represented here....Simply put because it's good and they knew it. If you are looking for one of the best World War II campaigns in gaming history and an online experience that still bustles today, then look no farther.",1,0
10090,"Probably one of the better Call of Duty games. Still has an active multiplayer community. Definitely worth buying, especially because what used to be DLCs are included in the deal.",1,1
10090,"Still my favourite Call of Duty title to date.  (Owned on PS3, X360, Wii, PC)  Seven years on and im still quoting game dialogue in normal conversations.",1,1

10090,"This is a great game, almost no flaws with very good graphics for a 2008 game. I highly recommend this game for everything it has, multiplayer, campaign and zombies! Custom maps are good too! You just need to find the right place to look! Awesome game, Treyach!",1,0
10090,Custom zombies makes this one of the best games on the Steam Store,1,1
10090,"Let's be real, if you're buying this game today it's only for the zombies (and the very fun campaign!). Sure the multiplayer is still there but it's a giant f&amp;#$fest which is only fun for a little bit before it get's old.  The zombies mode, and more importantly, the modded zombies maps are what make this game. If you go on the Steam WaW forums you'll always manage to find people to play with if you don't already have friends to play it with. The custom made maps range from being absolutely horrifying to extremely comedic. There are probably hundreds if not thousands of maps online that you can download and play on (look up a tutorial on how to download them if you aren't sure). This leads to pretty much infinite entertainment. I'd definetly pick this game up, but if you're not sure, just look up modded WaW zombies videos on youtube and see if you like them!  Btw I see people complaining that newer CoD games don't have co-op campaign but the reason they don't have it is obvious - the new campaigns are so bad it'd be a waste of time and money to implement co-op campaign since nobody would want to play it.",1,1
10090,"I bought this game for one reason only ... CUSTOM ZOMBIES!  First off, you'll never get bored of zombies as there are so much maps to pick from (there are websites with hundreds of maps).. literally it's endless.If you can get a few friends to buy it too and get all the same maps, it is just endless hours of fun.   However i didn't think much of the multiplayer side of this game as i expected it to be like the console - full of hackers and no one playing. Wow I was wrong!   I went in to expect no one online. Pressed refresh and hunders of severs and I had the option to filter it and only show servers that aren't modded. I even saw a few servers full of 40+ people playing! (Yep! 40+ people playing in the one match of TDM and on the tiny maps-- IT'S JUST CHAOS in a good way).   Seriously, buy this game for Campaign, Multiplayer and Zombies! Worth all of your money and all of your hours! Really fun and addictive. This is the game where Call of Duty was at it's best and if it wants to return to that, just remaster this f***ing game!  A MUST BUY! &lt;3",1,1

10090," PROS:  + 2 different WW2 fronts + variety of weapons and scenarios + co-op campaign + zombie modes + mod support + still strong playerbase   CONS:  - occasional graphical bugs &amp; glitches - AI issues in certain places - some problems with connecting to other players - meeting hackers   Comment:  This game is fantastic. No need to build up tension when a game this good is reviewed. By no means is it a perfect game but surely a very good WW2 FPS worth taking a look at. People who love WW2 shooters and war stories will get their fair share of epic scenes and combat. The variety is what shines, the fact that the missions don't get repetitive. This is thanks to 2 main campaign paths, one in the Pacific and the other in Europe (east front). Yes, we have seen some scenarios in previous CoD or MoH games. But it matters little because it takes a different take on these which keeps it fresh. It has some flaws, like AI being weird in a couple of places, or the occasional glitch. But overall the campaign is great and what makes it even better is the co-op option. That being said it is not always easy to connect to your friends. Same can be said for multiplayer in general but even though the game is old the playerbase remains quite steady. This might be partially because this is (so far) the last WW2 CoD game and mod support was still a thing here. To top off the posibilities this is the first time we get zombie modes in CoD. And it's glorious, especially custom zombies. Playing these modes with friends is loads of fun! I recommend this game and I advise you to get some mods after you finish with the base experience.   P.S.:  ignore the play time, I played a ton of this back in the day but I don't own a CD/DVD drive anymore so I bought it again on Steam to try it out",1,1

10090,"Heads up, ♥♥♥ down. Prepare for the best game ever.  This game is truely one of the best games and probably the best call of duty game too.  IT HAS EVERYTHING! ( I have probably over 200 hours on Xbox )  You can either go in to multiplayer with 64 players and re-act World war 2 or you could jump in to Zombie survival with over 9000 Maps ( seriously ) OR you could play a awesome campaign about fighting against the germans and Imperial army while being either a American or a Russian.

10090,If I got this game for $60 I wouldn't even be mad. The campaign is worth it. Very fun and the gore is a huge plus. Treyarch did an awesome job with this game. Unfortunately multiplayer servers are down. But campaign is loads of fun. Love the gritty feeling of this game.,1,1
10090,"If you know how to intall a mod, this game can have a lifetime's worth of play time.",1,1
10090,The campaign is a lot of fun. But it's also so brutal and so violent that it makes you think.  Call of Duty is good. Just not good enough to be bought again and again every year.  But World at War is definitely worth a purchase in my book.,1,1
10090,"Buy this game. Thats it, it is amazing",1,1
10090,"The last CoD to be set during WWII; also, the best one. Good ol' times of Call of Duty.   If you've got some spare bucks, spend them on this game, you will not regret it.   Pros: - Online multiplayer still heavily populated after all these years; - neat campaign (Pvt. Petrenko rules); - Nazi Zombies :)  Cons: - As a Historian, I'm stubborn as to accept weapons not being faction-locked (in online multiplayer, you have every weapon at your disposal, according to your level, but meh, many games are like that).",1,1
10090,"Excellent campaign, zombies &amp; mulitplayer that actually works! What's not to love? :D",1,1
10090,"Once upon a time, there was a Call of Duty game that, much like the others, recieved hate for being part of the CoD francise. However, it had many great things that people consider groundbreaking in newer CoDs such as gore and interactive map elements (in the form of tanks). Once upon a time, that game wasn't infested by hackers in multplayer. That game was Call of Duty World at War. A fantastic WW2 game that was on par with Brothers in Arms for showing how dark WW2 (or any war for that matter) was/can be. We had access to many weapons of devestation, from M1A1 Bazookas, to M2-2 Flamethrowers, and other feared weapons such as the MG42, or as many soldiers dubbed it, 'Hitler's Buzzsaw.' Explosives and large calibre ammunition showed their true power when they ripped apart characters limb by limb, the flamethrower engulfed and charred the bodies of soldiers in true awe. But the experience doesn't just end with a heroic end to a dark and gritty campaign and 80+levels of multiplayer, oh no, for an extra, small map had made it into the game; Nacht der Untoten, Night of the Living Dead. In a move that caught everyone, even many of the employees at Treyarch, offguard, an extra mode was added into Call of Duty that would be immortalized as a icon of the series. Nazi Zombies. Many players, myself included, spent countless hours having fun with this little surprise. And it didn't end there; more maps were added, and all Treyarch games since have had it included, as if the modding community wasn't putting out enough maps as it was. But its time was cut short when Modern Warfare 2 came out the next year and as the fanbase moved on, the hackers moved in, polluting the public multiplayer lobbies like a cancer, making people less inclined to play the game. And so ends the story of Call of Duty World at War... or does it? No, the game won't die for a long time because of its dedicated custom map making community, creating more and more great Zombies experiences each day.",1,1
10090,Just buy the ♥♥♥♥ing game cuz its amazing,1,1
10090,"One of the few Call of Duty games ACTUALLY WORTH YOUR MONEY AND TIME. World at War is quite possibly the best COD of all time. It takes place in the second Wolrd War and lets you play as not only the American marines fighting in Japan, but the Soviets fighting in Germany. From what I've seen, people still play multiplayer. You also get the 3 zombie map dlcs with this purchase so that is a plus. If you enjoy shooters and are a history lover, this game is perfect.",1,1
10090,i'm only writing this so i can get a badge  edit: some dude told me that i should write 'useful reviews' and 'contribute something helpful' so: its a pretty good game,1,1
10090,Extremely sexy,1,1
10090," Arguably the best of the franchise and well populated. Brilliantly nostalgic and still an absolute joy to play. PunkBuster can be a problem however.   'Call of Duty' was and remains a franchise at the forefront of the online FPS genre. Dominating both console and PC alike, it's rivaled some would say, only by it's EA counterpart 'Battlefield'; but 'World at War' was something else. Released in 2008 it adapted and built perfectly on the foundations set the previous year by Activision's installment in the series - 'Modern Warfare'.  Trearch's addition gave us features the likes of which we'd never seen in 'Call of Duty 4'. Vehicles. Tanks. Though on face value a simple addtion, their inclusion was well implimented and appropriatley balanced. We were also graced with a slightly new approach to the killstreak system, seeing the introduction of attack dogs; along with a tweaked 'Create-A-Class' system made to feel more period accurate, with bolt action rifles becoming an entierly different weapon type paired with the ability to use their iron-sights, as apposed to being restricted to a telescopic sight.  In terms of singleplayer, this installment saw you brave the horrors of WWII from both a Russian and American perspective; battling the Japanesse on Iwo Jima and beating down the 3rd Reich from Stalingrad to Berlin. Featuring the voice talents of Keifer Sutherland for the American Sgt. Roebuck, and Gary Oldman for the premier of the legendary hard-as-nails Russian sniper - Viktor Reznov. The campaign is both compelling and fantasicaly written with mixes of close and ranged combat along a spectrum of locales beautifully designed and planned. The singleplayer is, as far as im concerned, unsurpassable by any other 'Call of Duty' game.   However, my one biggest fault with 'Call of Duty: World at War' is the unfortunate lack of PunkBuster support. The anti-cheat system which now seems abandoned and disused is still required to play some servers in online matchmaking. Needing some Google searching to find a download of the appropriate files to enable the system to work. Although once this is done, the game plays fine and without further fault.  Oh, and not to mention. Zombies.   Recommended?:  Yes.  Score:  9/10",1,1
10090,Great game! Works on windows 8.1 and I have no problems!   Pros:  *has zombies *costom zombies *no whinney 12 year olds *graphics aren't half bad *one of the best multiplayer for call of duty *costom multiplayer maps *so many mods!!  Con's: *you haven't bought it yet *it takes like an hour and a half to download  ,1,1
10090,"Playing this f#cking game made me notice how much I miss the old WW2 FPS games, instead of the new futuristic crap wars that this franchise keeps making up to keep milking blind fans. The thing is, every time I tried to finish this game something happens and I couldn't finish it. Well, until now, that is. Is this game worth it or not? As usual, I'm gonna explain the bad things it has first, although being honest there's not much wrong with it.  First and foremost, the story is split in two different parts of WW2, the Americans trying to get revenge after the Pearl Harbor mess and Russia kicking some nazi ♥♥♥. And personally, the American part of the game needed some work. The characters are just SO DAMN BLAND, EVEN FOR COD STANDARDS. And it even tries to pull the   'suddenly killing an important character infront of you and you can't do anything about it' multiple times, and it fails to get anything because neither I know ANYTHING about those character, neither I even CARE about them.   It just means I'll have a different American dumb#ss yelling at me every 10 seconds.  Going further with the American side of the story, while they offer some nice changes from the rest of the series, they repeat itself a bit too much. Seriously, most of the American part of the game is spent crawling in trenches and holes in the ground. One of it's missions has one of the moments I most liked on the game, the whole level on the plane using all of those cool guns and it just makes me wonder WHY AREN'T THERE MORE OF THOSE AND LESS DAMN HOLES IN THE GROUND.  Also, the game is kinda short. Now sure, CoD games always have a short story mode but hell, in Modern Warfare titles they make up a dumb story behind all of the pew pew pew democracy MURRICA, here they didn't really need to think of a story as it wrote itself years ago. It lasts around 4 to 5 hours, but will take you more on high difficulties. It ends with a good taste, but it's a bit needlessly short to my refined-afro-fueled taste.  Lastly, it has some gameplay issues, similar to what you would expect from the rest of this damn ♥♥♥♥♥d franchise. Corpses freezing in mid-air, enemies doing nothing but spamming grenades on high difficulties, enemies respawining non-stop and even respawning in between your allies in insane places, that sort of stuff. Seriously, don't even bother to use normal grenades in anything that isn't normal or easy difficulty, most times enemies will just pick them up and throw them back at your face. Thank motherf#cking mother Russia the Soviet story has molotovs.  All of that being said, what does the game have to offer? Well, if you're played games such as the three original CoD's or Medal of Honor (before it went Modern Warfare Ripoff mode) then you'll know what to expect.  The story, while being a bit bland on the American side, is quite engaging and fun to go through. Specially the Russian side of it, which feels like it was done by completely different people, as...  ...Well, the Russian side it's just SO F#CKING GOOD. AMAZING MUSIC, AMAZING LEVELS, AMAZING CHARACTERS AND ACTION, JUST WHY COULDN'T THE GAME BE ALL WITH THEM!? I'M NOT JOKING.  Weapons are also great. You know this sh#t feeling you get in pretty much all CoD games that any weapon which isn't a Sniper Rifle or an Assault weapon is trash? Well, while Shotguns still seem to be irrelevant on this game, you'll be surprised to find that pretty much all weapons are useful. I actually do suggest switching and trying them all to find what suits your style more. Also, the American vs Japan and Russia vs Nazis stories have different weapons completely, which is a good effort.  Something that also surprised me were the vehicle sections. Both stories have a level in which you're in somewhat control of a vehicle, the Americans being the multiple turrets of a big-#ss plane and the Russians being a damn vodka-fueled tank of atomic destruction. Both of them were actually quite fun, specially the plane one.  The game also has Coop, although I couldn't try it out this time. I bet it's fun, but I wanted to try it out by myself anyway. The Coop that I did try is the Nazi Zombies mode a long time ago on the Xbox360 of a friend, and that sh#t is fun as hell.  Is the game worth it, then? Well, the problem is mainly the price. For 20€ I don't think it is. For that price, either wait for a sale that drops it to 5€ or lower, or just buy it on console, however I DO recommend playing it. It's fun, and a good throwback to the classic CoD's.  TL;DR Edition: Think of Modern Warfare 1 but with Vietnam flashes and the Soviet Union suplexing Nazis. It's fun as hell, specially the Coop with the Nazi Zombies unlockable mode, but 20€ is a bit way too much.",1,1
10090,"Campaign: This is by far my favorite campaign in Call of Duty. The grim, brutal and graphic nature of the campaign really makes the game feel like World War 2, the deadliest war of all time. You play as the Soviets against Nazi Germany in one campaign. You witness the beginning of the war with a grim scene of death and an enticing sniper battle. You then find yourself breaking into the heart of Germany and the destruction of the Fatherland. You also get to prove yourself as either an emotionless monster or a forgiving soul. You also play as the American's against the Japanese. You will witness the Japanese banzai tactics and guerilla warfare. You will go from hot, dry out in the open fighting to narrow caves and muddy, rainy hills. You will witness the downfall of the Japanese Empire from start to finish.  Both campaigns are very enticing and the missions, although action packed, are memorable and the environment/scenes make it seem realistic.  Multiplayer: The multiplayer is fun, although sadly their is no matchmaking for PC like their is on console. You have to search through the list of servers. A lot are crouch servers/tactical servers which can be a +1 or a -1. I'm personally fine with it. Game also comes with all DLC's so you get all the maps.  Zombies: Yes, zombies. The masterpiece of World at War. It all started here. You get all the zombie maps, plus there is hundreds of custom zombies maps that make the zombies experience endless. This is a big highlight of the PC version. You can easily play with your friends. You can do cheats as well. I'd say the zombies is the best reason to get the PC version over the console versions.  Graphics: Pretty nice for their time. I wouldn't criticize it since the rest of the game makes up for it.   Overall 9.5/10 I take 0.5 off for the lack of matchmaking. Otherwise I love WAW and have played it on my friends accounts and have spent atleast 100 hrs on the PS3 version.",1,1

10090,"Call of Duty: World at War. The last game before all the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ PC ports of the Call of Duty series. World at War (WaW) is the fifth iteration in the arcade shooter series that brings WWII elements in the COD universe. WAW is Made by Treyarch a company that has made titles such as 'Call of Duty: 2' and 'Call of duty: 3', so if you have played those you're in for a similar experience just much more shiny. The COD series also has another developer (Infinity Ward) that switches off on each of the series's games. WAW brings a whole new part of the series. A 4-Player cooperative game-mode named 'Nazi Zombies'. The new experience compiles intuitive gameplay like finding the best parts of a level to kill the undead or find out what weapons do the most damage.The campaign is 5-8 hours of Shooting mindless enemies on set pieces arranging from the heart of Russia to Nazi trenches. The multiplayer is class based with a perk system and customizable weapons. If you manage to get a certain amount of kills in a row you earn special kill-streaks. 3 kills is a UAV, 5 kills is an Artillery Strike, and 8 kills in a row you call in dogs to rip your enemies apart. Overall Call of Duty: World at War is a great buy if you like shooting up hordes of zombies all night with your friends. Or if you want to have a good time killing your way to the top in the leaderboards on multiplayer. Either way your going to have a good time with this game.",1,0
10090,Pros: Unique Custom Maps with hundreds of features Great modding commuinity Multiplayer works One of the best Cod games to date Decent graphics even for 2015 imo since this is mainly arcade Cons:  Mods arent directly in steam workshop though to me it isnt really a problem Some maps are hard load without someone informing you of how to use the console  This game is a must for me if you enjoy arcade style zombie games etc. the custom maps are amazing and make this much more than just a regular COD game.  ,1,1

10090,"After purchasing a gaming computer, this was one of the first games I downloaded. THE best purchase I have made on Steam. When World at War first came out, I only had an Xbox. I'd watch videos on YouTube of custom made zombie maps and I would weep silently as I was restricted to the stock &amp; DLC maps (which are still AMAZING). Call of Duty: World at War for PC gaming is everything I thought it would be and so much more.  Pros:  - Multiplayer is still popular, I'm normally playing in a server with between 14-40 people.  - Nazi Zombies, with hundreds of custom player made maps.   - Has 10 Prestiges (unlike CoD: 4) I find love that they added this for WaW. Through Prestiging, you can unlock 5 additional Custom Classes, for a total of 10 Customizable Classes.  - Singleplayer is incredibly fun and well done. I'm a sucker for WW2 games, so I admit that I am biased.  - Explosions and certain weapons will dismember enemies.  Cons:  - If you aren't with friends, or you haven't gone onto an online community to play Nazi Zombies/Custom NZ, you will more than likely not be able to find a game with a decent ping, which restricts you to SP Nazi Zombies. You can use cheats to help you out, if need be.  - Still has a few bugs here and there. The map Downfall occasionally crashes my game, and I will occasionally get kicked from servers upon loading new maps.  - Depending on the server, there will be hackers/try hards/cry babies/trolls. Enable Punkbuster and you should be okay (for hackers). I also tend to frequent the same 2 servers, which are usually monitored with an admin, and has a clan website where players can upload demos of suspected hackers.  - I find 20$ to be excessive for an 8 year old game (call me cheap idk), so I waited for it to go on sale and grabbed it for 10$  All in all, I have to give this a 9/10. The ability to play on customized zombie maps/mods allows you to spend hours trying out new maps or mods. I've been playing the Zombie Realism mod, which adds in a ranking system, custom classes, Prestige mode, weapon Challenges, and more. There aren't many 8 year old games that I can still have fun playing, but World at War is definitely one of them. ",1,1
10090,'You were killed by a grenade. Watch out for the grenade danger indicator.'  This is a message or tip that you will see quite frequently throughout World at War's campaign on the higher difficulties; Hardened and Veteran. This is due to the fact that more grenades are thrown at you in this game than there were manufactured during World War II.,1,1
10090,I love this game. Brings back old times.,1,1
10090,"Pretty good game, arguably the last good CoD.",1,1
10090,Why should you get World At War? It's pretty much obvious...,1,1
10090,The best game with zombie mode!,1,1
10090,"In my opinion, this is a nearly perfect game. It has an ok story, but you will overlook that very quickly as the gameplay and atmosphere captures the horror of World War 2 flawlessly, in both plot lines. In the first plot line, you play as an American soldier battling the Japanese, trying to capture an island that is full of booby traps and relentless enemies. This is a very cool way to play, with close quarters combat and ambushes aplenty, making the gameplay very suspenseful. In the other plotline, you play as a Russian soldier, firstly trying desperately to survive during a massive German invasion of a Russian town, then four years later, in 1945, you enter Germany and Berlin and brutally crush the German empire in what is a very satisfying set of levels. The first mission where you play as the Russian soldier is absolutely groundbreaking, filled with suspense and a dark, powerful atmosphere as you try to escape from the overkill that are the Nazis. Gameplay is your average Call of Duty game, it's fun and addictive, but on harder difficulty modes, it is extremely frustrating. Even on the easiest difficulty, you can bet that enemies will throw 3 grenades all aimed at you with no time to react. The Campaign is very entertaining and while short it has plenty of powerful moments, ESPECIALLY the ending, that was one of the best moments in a game, ever. The game looks absolutely beautiful, for a person that has to run PayDay 2 on lowest settings windowed to get 30 FPS it looks fantastic, even on lowest settings. The music is stunning, even right when you start the game you hear a track that grabs you into the game. Sadly, Campaign Co-op is dead and no-one plays it, so be sure to get friends if you want to play the Campaign with someone. Multiplayer is very good. On the XBox 360 and PlayStation 3 versions of the game, it is notorious for everyone to hack and spoil the game. Oddly, on the PC version, where it is far easier to cheat, you barely see any cheaters. In general, Multiplayer is very well alive and still has a lot of players to this very day, which is good, because multiplayer is very entertaining and amusing to playthrough online. Last, but certainly not least, the arcade-style Nazi Zombies mode. This is one of the best modes ever to be added to a video game, and would you believe it was added last minute? While the Zombies mode in Call of Duty: Black Ops is flawless and (for some extra money) contains all the WaW maps remastered, it's still incredibly fun, and if you ask a friend to play Zombies with you, they usually accept. Overall, this is an excellent game and one that should definitely be in your Steam library. Just, don't get it full price, for this old of a game paying £20 is just plain stupid.",1,1
10090,Remember when Call of Duty had no dlc........              Pepperidge Farm remembers.,1,1
10090,"Difficulty: Just Right The Bottom Line: Just Plain Fun/Great Score: 8.0  Note: This Game Been Tried Out And Reviewed In Offline Mode or On Another Steam Account And Or Consoles.  It may be a re-skin of CoD4 but that just means the Good War is back and it's better then ever.  Despite the grumblings of many, World at War shows there is still a lot of fight left in WWII as a setting. And despite some obvious shortcomings, like the broken audio and straightforward story, World at War is every bit as intense, polished and fun as it's predecessor. The presentation is top notch, with cutscenes that mix real wartime footage with sleek, modern graphics. The short singleplayer campaign is helped by a terrific multiplayer and co-op portion as well as the ever fun Nazi mode. World at War doesn't reinvent the wheel by staying snugly in Modern Warfare's shadow, but it does make for a thrilling and enjoyable ride that fans of WWII and shooters alike are sure to appreciate.",1,0

10090,"Before you criticize my review based on my playtime shown above, I have played this game an absolute ♥♥♥♥ ton on console.  With that being said...  Campaign: It's fun if you're into it.  Multiplayer: Haven't touched it though I assume it's dead.  Zombies: The reason you should get this game. All the DLC is included free of charge so you don't have to mess with paying more for zombie maps. Also, there are tons of custom zombie maps that people have made so you will pretty much never get bored of zombies. The game is incredibly user friendly when loading up custom zombie maps from online so you don't have to install any bull sh*t mods or program to use them. Also, while there are some mediocre zombie maps, there are also a ton of well designed maps that in some cases due to easter eggs or new features outshine the ones that the game comes with. To add, because zombies on Black Ops 1 and 2 aren't exactly mod friendly, custom map makers have turned to integrating a lot of BO1 and BO2 zombies features in World at War. From guns to perks like Mule Kick and extra pack a punch features like cool looking skins for guns when you pack a punch it, these custom maps become more than just a room with spawn points. Hell, there's even buyable endings where you can literally beat the map after you rack up enough points depending on what it's set at (do not confuse buyable with actually having to buy and ending with real money, it's all using the in game points so don't worry about having to pay for extra sh*t. Though this may seem like a lot, or a little if you're a skeptic, this is just a surface level review of what there is to offer in this game through custom zombie maps. You do not have to pay for any map that you download (that I know of) and there's plenty of ways to get these maps. Personally, I just go to youtube and watch well known zombie players playing custom maps that they think are cool and conveniently they link the download to the map. Pretty trusted resource cause, you know, the internet would never lie to me.   Anyways, here's a TL;DR  Get this game mainly for zombies. All DLC included and custom maps are easily available and easy to use. IMO the custom maps are better than the original ones. Worth.  10/10",1,1
10090,This Game is the ♥♥♥♥! Best campaign ever + zombies + mods + friends + other stuff = Mind blown mathmatical ♥♥♥♥! P.S Did I mention you can drive tanks? in multiplayer!!!11!!,1,1

10090,"Ok..... lets be real... WaW xbox 360 or ps3 complete waste of money.

If you are a COD zombies fan and you don't own this already tf are you doing with your life. Even when this game is at full price its worth it for a !!!!COD ZOMBIES FAN!!!!....

You truly have forgoten the face o your father! If you reviewed this game as hacker is multiplayer glitches is multiplayer.... i mean what did u expect!

If you think your going to get this and actually play multiplayer and enjoy it, where have u been under a rock everyone and his mother knows you only buy this game for ZOMBIES! get a life get a better computer or a newer version of COD.. This game, in NO WAY IS IT A WASTE OF MONEY, if you think it is your the waste, i repeat do what you have to, to get a better computer or more money and stop complaining!",1,1
10090,"GREAT GAME I recomend it. But only for single player or coop zombies. But if you're getting it for the multiplayer don't even bother. The game Litteraly has 0 servers in multiplayer. Maybe for you, servers actually show up on the list, but not for me.",1,1
10090,"  Call of Duty: World at War   is a first person shooter created by Treyarch for PC and consoles. Originally named '  Call of Duty 5  ', the game continues, and subsequently finishes, the World War II setting started from the first game, '  Call of Duty  '. It is the first game within the '  Call of Duty: Black Ops  ' series, although not branded/labeled as a 'Black Ops' game itself. It is considered the goriest, most emotionally hard hitting, and realistic   Call of Duty   video game to date.    Call of Duty: World at War   is a fictional video game depicting the fictional lives of two Privates during the denouement of World War II. The game starts with an American Army soldier named Private C. Miller and his journey throughout the beaches and lands of Japan, marching and fighting his way through Makin, Okanawa, and Peleliu Island with Sergeant Thomas Sullivan (who is murdered by a Japanese soldier early in the campaign), who is later replaced by Sergeant Roebuck. After the American-sided introduction, the game then switches to Soviet Union Red Army soldier Private Dimitri Petrenko, and his journey with Sergeant Reznov, Private Chernov, and the rest of the Red Army as they charge their way throughout Stalingrad in Russia, to the fields of Seelow in Germany, and subsequently to Berlin as they cut down all in their path, fighting and brutally slaughtering their way into the Reichstag, to slice down the facist Reich's flag, and to wave ultimate victory over Germany for Mother Russia.  Campaign ================================ The game starts with the American campaign, with Pvt. Miller, along with Sgt. Roebuck and Sullivan, charging through Makin with their battalions, falling into ambushes, and blowing up an ammo depot. The game, after 3 American based missions, switches to the Russian side of the campaign. The Russian campaign starts with the player, Pvt. Petrenko, lying in the slaughter of his comrades after a massacre at a fountain at the Red Square in Stalingrad. The player then continues with Sgt. Reznov to assassinate a German General named Amsel, to avenge the fallen soldiers who had died at Stalingrad. Afterwards, they escape Stalingrad and begin their own adventure to take back Russia, and later Berlin.  The game continues with multiple battles and conflicts, which when paired with Sean Murray's amazing music, make the whole experience very emotionally hard hitting, and unforgettable. To the Russian Battle Theme, and the 'Black Cats' fighting theme, the game deliveres an amazing experience that reminisces of the golden days of   Call of Duty   video games.  Zombies ================================   Call of Duty: World at War   intruduces a new 'Nazi Zombies' mode into the franchise. The mode centers around an operative (or a group of operatives) as they are stranded at a certain base, in need of rescue, from a pending Nazi Zombie invasion. The group/player must work together/alone to fight their way through the carnage and to escape the compound they are in, being supplied with multiple weapons, and powerups through the way.  This mode is definitely worth a try, and a good move on Treyarch.  Multiplayer ================================ With the singleplayer campaign, the game also presents a co-op mode, which allows you to play the campaign with friends. It enables the new 'DeathCards' cheats, which reveal special cheats as you collect them throughout the campaign. They're mostly jokes, such as the cheat that replaces all your weapons with stones. I ♥♥♥♥ you not.  While the true multiplayer is broken, it can be fixed by following the  PC Gaming wiki article here  [pcgamingwiki.com] .  Upon fixing the multiplayer, most players will notice that almost all the servers are sadly modded. Most servers have leveling cheats enabled, where-in your first 5 minutes of gameplay the player will most likely already be leveled to level 28. I have suffered this, and many others have/will too.  Ignoring that, the multiplayer is mostly fun. There's multiple modes that will deliver a fun arcade experience for the player. Nothing much to say here.  Issues/Bugs/Glitches ================================ Albeit all the great things about the game, it does present multiple issues. For starters, the game has a failsafe where if the player does not advance at all, it will start spamming grenades at the player until they move forward. On most difficulties, this is usually 1 to 3 grenades. While this doesn't sound too bad, it becomes a terrible experience on Veteran difficulties, as the player will most likely have 6-7, even 8 grenades thrown at them at once.  The game also suffers from terrible AI issues. An example is in 'Vendetta', the first Russian campaign mission. During the part where you must protect your comrades as they storm a communications center, sometimes of the AI will become confused, and refuse to navigate. This results in a crash, which you must ALT+TAB out to see (as the game does not close automatically). Sadly, this has happened to me at least 4 times throughout the campaign, with both American and Russian campaigns. The AI can also be oblivious to enemies, where they (sometimes) will stand their and absorb bullets until they die, doing nothing. This is most prominant on Veteran mode, and leads to an annoying experience, since your comrades will not help you AT ALL during these fire-fights. Happily, Sgt. Roebuck nor Reznov will never have these errors; as Reznov stays in the back (never moving unless it's a scripted event), and Roebuck stays behind cover all of the time throwing grenades and using his pistol. The enemies also feel like they all have aimbot on higher difficulties, and aren't actually aiming for the armies as a whole; just you and you alone.  Final Remarks ================================ I definitely recommend this game to EVERYONE who has a love for first person shooters, war video games, or Call of Duty games, as this game will find a way to take camp in anyones heart and mind.  This game is simply amazing, despite the issues it has, and definitely deserves a chance to be played by everyone.  ================================    FINAL RATING :  8/10",1,1

Treyarch did a phenomical job, and the WW2 era is something that I sorely miss in today's games. Not to mention that this introduced the world famous zombie modes. Some of the free zombie mods are worlds better than what you can get as paid dlc, or even full games from other sources or consoles. They really outdid themselves with this game.

TBH im not a zombies fan however, this has teh best maps for zombies and is just cool. WIth custom maps aswell that just makes my 7/10 go to a 9/10. wont give 10/10 until i like zombies ;) Last is MP. same engine as cod4 in ww2. What is there to hate, fine there not many good servers as they are all 64 man XD. I want a classic 5v5 / 6v6 game to be perfect. there are extra xp / easy prestige servers if you cba to grind and tbh i dont see why you wouldnt use those servers.

10090,"I know I've only played this game for two hours on PC, but I already know what this game is all about from playing both the PS3 and 360 versions of it for years.   After experiencing all the annoying ♥♥♥♥ that's plagued the console versions of WaW, the PC version was a refreshing change from all the god mode, no clip, infection, infinite ammo, XP hacking ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s on consoles.   Another major bonus of WaW on PC is custom zombies which, after being able to play as a shotgun wielding Patrick Star shooting up dozens of Bubble Buddy zombies, further solidified my love for WaW on PC.   All in all, if you're a console gamer looking to escape the mess that is WaW on consoles, get yourself a decent PC, buy this game (preferably when it's on sale because $9.99 is a hell of a lot better than paying $19.99 for an almost eight year old game), and enjoy WaW before it went to ♥♥♥♥ on consoles.   Oh, one word of advice for console gamers wanting to play this version of WaW, the mouse and keyboard makes it easier to aim in this game so don't be surprised when you get sniped dozens of times out of nowhere immediately after you spawn.   10/10 would pop hundreds of bubble buddies with a shotgun and get sniped out of nowhere immediately after spawning again.",1,1
10090,"*EDIT* This is one of the last good Call of Duty games in my opinion. The Black Ops series was well put together also, and Advanced Warfare turned out to be good so far. But I always come back to this CoD, because of how simple it is, and the amount of people that still play this game after 6 Years of it's release. I love this game, because of the campaign and most of all the zombies. Considering that they have a lot of custom maps, it just makes this game worth playing anytime. I recommend this game to anyone who loves to play Call of Duty and the Zombies mode itself.",1,0

Campaign: nice story with good characters like reznov not much else to say about it but tis a nice campaign but once you complete it its not a thing you really want to go back and do again, it also has co op which is pretty good as well  Zombies: This is a amazing gamemode the only thing i think makes this game worth the money its so good you have all the dlc maps and the disk map which is very good but the thing that makes it amazing is custom zombies you have endless possibilitys you could have a map filled with santa zombies you could have a map made of cheese you can have like everything its amazing  So overall this game is very good, recommend it",1,1

10090,"To this day, Call of Duty: World at War still holds up as one of the greatest first person shooters of all time. To give a full perspective on the game, I will do this review in three parts:  Campaign: Probably the weakest aspect of the game, but still fun to run around play through World War II environments. Its story feels a bit less personal and epic as some of the other titles (Modern Warfare, Black Ops), however it isn't by any means bad and can still be enjoyed. The mechanics of the campaign can be somewhat odd, with things like random grenade spawning which cause a bit of annoyance. But, on the whole it's still a fun time. World at War also has a co-op campaign feature, something that has not been seen since in the series.  Multiplayer: This is where World at War really shines. In general, the game is designed around being skill based, and as such you are rewarded for being a good player. Now, that doesn't mean there isn't the occasional iffy mechanic in the game (martyrdom), however most of the time you earn your kills and deserve your deaths. The TTK (time to kill) is higher than other games, making gun accurasy and controlling recoil key. The game has generally very strong maps (Castle, Cliffside, Downfall, Nightfire etc.), and each map generally accomidates to a variety of skill sets and has a variety of sightlines (again, reinforcing good aim and gun control being rewarded). All in all, this game has a near perfect multiplayer and to this day remains a great experience.   Bonus - Zombies: Although Zombies has come to be expected out of modern Treyarch Call of Duty titles, in World at War it was a hidden bonus mode that caught on like wildfire. That's right, World at War is where this whole zombies craze started. There are 4 zombies maps in total (although you can download additional countless ones via user created maps), including my personal favorite map Zombies map ever, Der Riese. However, every map is enjoyable. The biggest weakness in World at War's Zombies is the zombie grab, which can often cause frustration and being automatically down with no chance to get away. However, if you're good enough, you can avoid this for the most part. Although future games are more refined (and brought these maps back), World at War Zombies is still an incredibly enjoyable experience, and has an endless amount of mod content.   Extra and Closing Thoughts: As I mentioned in the Zombies section, there is a wealth of moddable content for this game. This includes maps, guns, skins, modes etc., essentially creating a game you can spend an infinite amount of time and never be bored. In addition, PC players got ALL of World at War's DLC Content for free! However, it is worth noting that the community [as of mid 2014, 5.5 years after release] is slowly dying out, and you could eventually run into an issue finding a desireable game. That being said, this is an excellent game, one of my personal favorite FPS games of all time, and I highly recommend picking it up!",1,0

10090,"The only good call of duty, people say the older ones are awesome, but they were mediocre compared to this.    Pros:Barely any kids There's a lot of realism involved Actual recoil that's not fake engine trash. Snipers aren't offensive and snipers don't quickscope. Infact, it's impossible to quickscope since sniper in WaW actually takes skill on aiming because of breathing patterns and shuttering. Most alive CoD on PC Historically accurate on world war II.  Cons:WHAT ♥♥♥♥ING CONS? IT'S ONE OF THE BEST 'MODERN' FPSES EVER MADE.",1,1

10090,"Call of Duty World at War is a classic World War 2 First Person Shooter. Infact it is one of the better ones. In the Singleplayer Campaign you switch between two fronts: The Japanese-American and the Russian-German Front. Both Stories are alright, but the Russian one has way more Character Development than the American One. The Multiplayer is your Basic Call of Duty Multiplayer, but with (of course) WW2 Guns. The Multiplayer has small, but also some Bigger Maps. On some Big Maps you can even use Tanks to destroy your Enemies. After beating the Capmpaign you unlock the Zombie Mode 'Nazi Zombies', which is the best thing about this game. Fight the undead horde round by round as long as possible. Arms yourself up with guns and perks and slay em all &gt;:3. This game also supports mods. There are many mods for this game which add more zombie-Maps to play on. The modding Community is still active. If you like WW2 and Zombies CoD WaW is the game for you.",1,0

Multiplayer is still very good to play on. I've had little to no trouble finding games and the servers have very few if any cheaters on them. Because it is a call of duty it uses the same gameplay mechanics that the most current one uses so to this day it still feels like a modern shooter. I would highly recommend this game... but wait for it to be on sale because it is not worth $20.",1,0
10090,Extremely fun game to play with your friends. I can never get enough of the custom zombie maps that people are still making for this game.

Jump on that mic and run through the campaign with your friends in one caffiene fuled night of pure call of duty bliss.

The only downside i have founde is that almost every multiplayer server is hacked so you can barely play. The primary reason I got this game was for zombies. Well, custom zombies. If you didn't know, you can download maps as a mod and play them. You could also make them, but thats extremely difficult. Overall, this is a great game and worth every penny.",1,0

10090,"To start the review there are four words you need to know about this game:'One Of The Best!'The rest of the review will consist of things that are great about this game in numerical order.1.Amazing Graphics-Imressive.2.The dual battling campaign is amazing with the Russians battling the Germans and the Americans over in Japan.3.Nazi Zombies is the best mode ever-There are all most unlimited downloadable mapsto choose from such as zombiemodding and ugx_maps. Some maps are straight up hilarious and other, battling to your last breath.4.Npc's-Npc's in this game are not those other npc's who shoot at walls over and over again and don't act like you want them to. 5.Multiplayer-This is never ending fun! I love themaps where you can drive tanks and battle tank vs. tank battles.6. Tis game is never laggy for me and my computer isn't the newest computer out there.7. If I had to rate this game it would be a 10/10, totally get this game!",1,0
10090,Call of Duty: World at War is a blast!   The campaign got boring after the first couple of missions and there isn't a multiplayer community anymore but Zombies is so much fun!   There is such an awesome Custom Zombies community and soooooo many maps you can play aside from the maps that come with the game! If you are into survival or wave type games then this is a must have and you need to buy this now!,1,0
10090,"A really good fps shooter. One of the best in the COD series. The campaign is good, but I'm not too big of a fan of the multiplayer. The best part of the game is zombies! I just love zombies.

10090,"This is an honest review of Call of Duty: World at War    There's few games that really outshine this one. I've been playing this game for a long time, even though It says I've only got 70 or so hours at the moment. My favorite gamemode is by far the zombies, don't get me wrong, the campaign and multiplayer are fantastic. But the zombies is where this game really shines in my opinion.  Pros: -Awesome story -Huge multiplayer maps with vehicles  -Extremely realistic hardcore mode -Zombies -Custom, downloadable zombies and multiplaer maps -An actually quality level PC port  Cons: -Small-ish community -Very hard to get into low-ping public zombies servers -Graphics are outdated (not that it really matters to me, but it's a con for most people) -Crashes happen when you try to switch your online profile -Tanks are OP (as they should be, but its none the less annoying)  FINAL VERDICT:  Overall, You could have many hours of fun with your friends in this game. If you have no friends who play this game, it is less of a rewarding experience. If you do buy this game, I would highly recommend playing through the campaign, it is really worth your time.

10090,"Call of Duty: World at War is a great game. The campaign is engaging and replayable, the multiplayer is fun and enjoyable, and the zombies mode that was introduced from this game that is still in the newer Treyarch titles is a fun game to play with friends.  Pros- [Campaign]- Good story and characters, engages you, challenges you, and is only the lead into the stories of BO1 and 2. [MP]- People still play this almost 9 year old game. [MP]- Guns are varying, meaning you aren't going to get killed by one gun and one only (but beware of PPsh users) [ZM]- Simple and easy to learn. [ZM]- Fun for co-op or online. [ZM]- Custom zombies. [Campaign]- This is a personal opinion, but this game is gorey-er than other COD campaigns, and I think it impoves immersion  Cons- [Campaign]- Although I said its challenging, sometimes it's too much so. [Campaign]- The Pacific Theatre gets boring towards the end, and you almost want it to end there. [MP]- Juggernaut. Enough said. [MP]- Anymore, most servers are not vanilla, meaning it will probably be modded in some way. [ZM]- It gets repetitive after a while, due to simplicity.  Final Verdict- Campaign- 8.75/10. It's good, but not amazing. Multiplayer- 9/10. Probably the best multiplayer in a COD game. Zombies- 9.5/10. The second best Zombies mode so far, only behind Black Ops 1. Overall [Average of all scores]- 9.11/10. My favorite COD, and to many others one of the best in the series.",1,0
10090,"( First impression review ) AWESOME game though can't find a single person to play classic zombies :/ but overall good game love it though the multiplayer is something eh i'm not use to lol i've played through black ops and mw3 multiplayer and waw's multiplayer is way better it feels way down to the game for new players i haven't seen stuff like this in along time my vote 10/10 recommend you buy it :D  ( Edit 1) After playing this game for x ammount of tme and running it through 'most' of it's paces i've decided to edit my review of this game, the game is great all around but in some aspects/features it lacks so i'ma get down to my review at the bottom of this starting with the story mode.  1. Story Mode/single player- I found this game's story quite good though it's very laggy and hard to get into at first I give it a 5/10.  2. Story Mode/Co op - when playing the story mode with friends my game as well as theirs would crash for no appearant reason and i have yet to find the cause i give the co op story mode a 2/10  3. Networking/match making - when joining a co op round with a friend in rare times either person was unable to join the other's match and i have yet to find a cause or a fix to this issue and it is quite rare i give networking/matchmaking a 6/10 for all around.  4. Solo mode zombies - I find this one of the best modes of the game i love it the most cause i can sit and play even with out cheats and go Very far in waves or rounds and have music playing with out worrying about my team mates i give solo mode zombies a 10/10  5. Co op Zombies - I find it hard to find a match for zombies it's sometimes none existant when it is most of the time it's modded maps or people using cheats of some kind but for just private matchs with friends i give the co op zombies a 10/10 for online use i give it a 0/10 because i can't play in a public match because it's mostly private premade teams now.  6. Multiplayer - I like the Multiplayer of world at war but most of the servers are either using cheats or mods and it's extremely hard to find a match enless you custom search one for with out mods or cheats that is in the game mode you desire, Also with most servers the health is very low that being said in most servers the bullets that it takes to kill you are around 3 to 5 rather than almost a full clip depending on the right happen i find this a major disappointment because it's hard to find the guy and shoot him before he shoots me and most times it's a one shot from accross the map so i give multiplayer a 6/10.  7. Graghics/ effects - I have yet to put these through their paces because i'm still running on low settings because my laptop sucks but when i get my new computer and re run this game at max i'll revise my review and add my rating on these but for now i can't.  8. Sound effects - I have to give the sound effects a strong 9/10 they are superb 99 times in each match depending on the weapon.  9. mechanics - the game is old that being said i can't even give it a strong review on these because of it being as old as it is so i'ma give the mechanics a 10/10 for them being as old as they are  10. playerbase - This game has good playerbase alot of nice peopl and such and it's very easy to get a co op or co op zombie match going this being said i give it a 10/10  11. Taking out of all my reviews i give the entire game a 8/10 for it's age and the fact that in some features i can't really put them through their full potential yet i will however do so when i get a better computer.",1,0

10090,"Unlike with my Black Ops 2 review, this game comes as one game under your Steam Library but is a 3 part game, Campaign, Multiplayer and Zombies. So i will be doing the one review for the parts individually.   WaW - Campaign   Its Veteran Campaign is the hardest campaign i have ever completed on any game ever. Regardless of wether it is a CoD or Battlefield or friggin' The Sims, i don't care it's purely hard. Unfortunately (Or fortunately in this case) the Steam version of this game does not have achievements so i cannot prove i have completed it on Veteren, and honestly i havent completed it on Veteren on Steam. I completed the Veteren campaign on the PS3 version of this game a long while back before i started PC gaming. After having gotten every single achievement and my Platinum Trophy i vowed to never ever ever attempt this Veteren Campaign again. As i said earlier unfortunately this version doesnt have achievements so i dont have enough reason to attempt such a feat again to prove my worth.   I can assure you back in the day there was much rage, controller throwing and much swearing loudly. I have since barely ever raged again, im pretty sure it's because no matter how hard something is or how much better a player in a multiplayer game is than me, there is always this Veteren campaign that is harder.  Having said all of that i really enjoyed the campaign, despite it being clearly quite old by todays standards it's quite a fun campaign (as long as you are not attempting it on Veteren)   WaW - Multiplayer   This game is old and this does reflect in the multiplayer games. There are quite a lot of One Shot lobbies in the multiplayer mode, it seems to be the more popular due to how much fun the sniper rifles are in this game and how old it is too i guess. You can find some normal team deathmatch games here too but its not a super busy game on the multiplayer servers from what i have seen, most people will have moved on to the newer CoD multiplayer games i imagine.   WaW - Zombies   This is the game mode that you buy this game for. World at War created Zombies, this was the first ever CoD game to put a zombies mode in. Having said that you only get one base map which isnt that great. What is pretty great is that all of the DLC for the Steam version of this game is completely free so you can get 3 other zombies maps too. This is unlike the PS3 version i played many moons ago in which i had to buy all the DLC. The DLC Zombies maps on this game do pale in comparison to the newer CoD games with zombies but that is to be expected since its the first time they have existed in CoD.  So that is awesome you have 4 zombies maps just like the console versions.   LOL. This is PC ♥♥♥♥♥ES!!!!   For the PC version of this game you have a WHOLE COMMUNITY based on ZOMBIES. There are literally THOUSANDS of Custom Built maps for this game. You can find such maps all completely FREE to download at many numorous websites that host links to maps made by Custom Mappers. You can see hundreds and thousands of videos on Youtube if you pretty much just type 'custom zombies' into youtube search bar to see huge varieties of maps. There are maps that are designed entierly from the map makers imagination or maps made based on real life enviroments wether it be the mappers workplace, house or local supermarket. There are maps based on TV shows such as The Simpsons, Family Guy, Spongebob Squarepants, My Little Pony - Yes i said My Little Pony!!  Even i myself have made a few custom maps - the mod tools are free for anyone to use to create your own maps usually available from the many websites that host these maps alongside tutorials on how to use them and many forum posts giving advice on how to use them.  So that is why you buy this game pretty much only for the custom zombies maps, you could spend probably over 2000 hours playing every single map for like 30 minutes each easy with probably some maps you could spend a few hours playing.  Some of the websites you can find custom maps and tutorials on how to make your own etc:   zombiemodding.com    ugx-mods.com    undeadmodding.com    triple-mgames.com   and so on, there are tonnes of them :P",1,0

Waw felt terrifying at times, the match will get quiet until you hear the echo of a rifle crack across the map, taking out your teammates leg in a horrifying fashion. This was the only cod to ever actually feature real gibbing (aside from zombies and that scene in cod 4 where you shoot someones arm off). I always make fun of cod for being mindless and such but this one is considered (to me) to be the best and I would recommend it to ANYONE. Its replayability is almost infinite as long as there are friends and good servers. Also there are custom zombie maps if you get bored or just want a break from the originals.",1,0

10090,"Recently bought this game on steam (put in alot of hours before on non-steam edition) Its a great game, my favorite part is the 4 player co-op option for the campaign, I don't understand why more games don't have this kind of feature. Along with that the storyline is heck of all fun, its not take one level and then copy-paste it and call it a campaign, the missions are actually unique through the entire game! The multiplayer is fine, its frustrating when people start camping in buildings, but its pretty rewarding to kill them and claim your revenge! By now most likely you're probably getting this game for Zombies, still somewhat active, but I wouldn't recommend playing on pub matches, playing with friends is really the only way to play this game, which is an awesome way to play.  7/10 (Zombies doesn't have a whole lot of maps, not a great many zombies matches, even then you do get kicked out of some of them, and multiplayer is frustrating at times, thats why its not 10/10)",1,0

Granted it works best when you have a friend to play this game with as that is when it will really shine, espeically the zombies modes with all of the custom maps that it can provide.

10090,"Remaster World at War Please for 2017 !!!  FInal world war II game by call of duty , introducing the battlefront upon the pacific featuring the battle at okinawa and other major battles along the turning tides of pacific.   Along the starts of the pacfic the major focus on the eastern front on the advance of the soviet red army into nazi germany , including battles such as the battle of stalingrad ,seige of berlin. However the main focus on private reznov on his story upon the leading events in call of duty black ops . Overall the multiplayer gameplay is very lacking as it faces the road of extinction with its population dying day by day .  The best part of the game in focused on zombies as the game introduces the new zombie mode and first maps such as nachet de toten , verruckt , shi no nu ma and der ries , overall interesting game for everyone to consider getting !

Despite it's 2008 release date, this CoD game remains the winner of the best CoD (My opinion, don't get your ♥♥♥♥ into a twist) due to the harshness of the war, the astounding (Not entirely hacked) Multiplayer, and my personal favorite, Nazi zombies. While this game may have been made in 2008 don't think the community is dead, daily custom zombie maps are being made which offers unlimited replayability meaning that for a 2008 game, it has more content than all the other CoD's put together. The multi-player is also amazing, if you choose a non hacked lobby I guarantee you will have an awesome time on it, without having to worry about all those 10-13 year olds who 'sleep' with your mom. As for the campaign, it puts you in the place of different people fighting on different sides during WW2, it is harsh, bloody, and total hell on veteran difficulty. Perfect for gorehounds like me who like a challenge :) . There should be no reason to not pick this game up if you have the funds. Since for $20 it has offered 200 and counting hours of fun gameplay.

A cool and interesting story line when you switch between 2 different soldiers. One fighting Japan and the other taking back Russia. But the best part comes when you play zombies. When I first played this game on my Xbox all I did was play zombies. It was what made me get into zombies today. A couple years latter I get a good computer and buy this game.

10090,"Well, what can I say about this game? I can start off by saying that it is the most   outstanding brilliant   game modded! Being a modded game may sound bad but it does come with its advantages!  Main advantage:   Modded Zombies.   People mainly buy this game mostly for the zombies purely because the multiplayer servers for CoD: WAW is pretty much dead, everyone plays the later instalments of CoD but if you're a true zombie player like yoteslaya or yamimash, then you will love this game. This game has the standard campaign and when you finish that, you will unlock a game mode called Zombies. Zombies is a game mode where you will receive an endless amount of zombies going up in waves. E.g. wave 1: 8 zombies, wave 2: 14 zombies and so on.  Because this game is quite dated, it is easily modded and most of the modders live on a site called     www.zombiemodding.com   There are hundreds of zombies maps designed for CoD: WAW zombie players, modded to the extreme as they include;    Custom Zombie maps designed by the community, not any standard zombies map    Guns are ported across from MW1/MW2/MW3/Black ops 1/2 and maybe some AW guns in the future!    Player models can be changed for example, in some WAW maps you can play as some of the characters from Black ops 1: Call of the Dead    The list just goes on!   Second Advantage: It's not even that hard to download modded zombie maps, on the website  www.zombiemodding.com  they simply ask you to download an .exe file which will install the zombie maps in the directory C:\Users\&lt;YOUR COMPUTER NAME&gt; \AppData\Local\activision\codwaw\mods. If you even wanted to design your own zombie map, it takes about a few days to learn how to do it and a good couple of weeks to finish of a piece of well-designed work. Not much code involved.       How do i play these maps?       http://store.steampowered.com  You have to click the 'MODS' option which will bring up a list of your installed maps.   url=store.steampowered.com ]  http://i.imgur.com/dralY4T.jpg  [/url]      Google chrome says these modded maps from zombie modding are malicious?      I am not quite sure why google chrome says these maps are malicious, probably because they are .exe files. Don't worry, if you download them from zombie modding then they should be virus free, if not report them on the website.   Thank you for reading my review, if it's any good thumbs up so others can see.",1,0

Hackers are nowhere to be seen unlike the console versions.  Finally the campaign is good enough to play, as you arent the super mach Mason. Instead you are a pvt, with multiple superioirs at your assistance. You arent alone.",1,0

10090,"This is going to be my overview of Call of Duty: World at War, but I am only going to be looking at the Zombies mode.  Nacht Der Untoten: A great map to start off Zombies. That Ray Gun though.  Verrukt: Nothing special, it introduced those Sanic Zombies. And the PPsH-41. And the Perk-a-Cola's. Man this map had a lot of stuf-  Shi No Numa:This map introduced my favorite wunder weapon in Zombies, you guessed it the Wunderwaffe DG-2, also Hell Hounds were also introduced.  Der Reise: The best Zombies map out of BO1 and WaW. BO2 had Origins... sorry Der Riese. Plus Pack-a-Punch was intorduced.

10090,spoiler alert = the nazis lose,1,1
10090,"CoD: World at War, is EASILY one of the best Call of Duty games ever made. First off, the game goes back to its WW2 roots, after the giant success which is Modern Warfare. The single player campaign is solid, it really helps that WaW focuses on some of the less popular battles from World War II, instead of giving you battles on D-Day at Normandy, which would have been like the millionth recreation within a WW2 game, the game covers an American campaign across multiple islands in the Pacific, as well as the Red Army's comeback at the battle of Stalingrad, which leads up to the Fall of Berlin. All of this provides lots of interesting new battlefields. You will still see some more familiar spots within bombed-out cities, and the farmlands of the Eastern Front missions, but it is all still incredibly well done. War, as you probably know, is an unforgiving and brutal affair, but the Pacific and the Eastern Front were especially so. In the game, Japanese soldiers will swarm you out of bushes, erupting straight out of spider holes and charge straight at you in an attempt to run you through with their bayonets. They'll play dead and wait for you to walk into the middle of a trap. Although the game is primarily set outdoors, most of the game is played in close quarters combat. Meanwhile, on the Russian Front, there are plenty of absoulutely merciless moments to be had. Soldiers on both sides of the war on this front, Russian, and German. Soldiers of both sides gun down wounded or unarmed soldiers, and sometimes you're asked to pull the trigger yourself in situations like this. But, this remains a Call of Duty game, through and through. What I mean by this, is that the action is both fast, and fluid, and the game is rigidly scripted. Enemy soldiers, as well as your computer-controlled teammates respawn endlessy until you advance far enough to hit the triggers to make them stop coming at you. Then, you find yourself at the next firefight, and repeat the process all over again, but, you're usually far too busy ducking, and shooting your way around the level, and occasionaly dying, to really notice this much of the time. The sense of immersion is really outstanding. There are plenty of deafinging, large-scale battles, but there's also a bit of variation to change things up. A perfect example is the PBY mission, where man the guns of a Navy aircraft, while you are in the midst of a raging air AND sea battle, taking fire, and fighting for your life, while trying to save the lives of sailors stranded in the water. All of this sounds great, but it hurts the game in one way. The narrative skips over months at a time, and showcases the major battles in the campaign. The result of this, is that the sense of story may not be as strong as you would expect it to be. In the end, the single-player campaign is relatively short, but it doesn't drag on too long to be unenjoyable either. And, as a bonus, there is a lot of replayability in the story, because the bulk of the campaign is playable in cooperative mode, with up to three other players. Multiplayer (while it has A LOT less players than console, or than when the game originally launched) is an area where WaW shines REALLY bright. Modern Warfare, quite arguably had on of the best multiplayer suites in history, and WaW built upon it. There is a create-a-class system, and a ranking system, that lets you unlock perks, weapons, and other general upgrades, that you can use as the building blocks for tailor your own personal load-out, and play-style. Kill-streaks are in the game, and are simmilar to Modern Warfare's, but with a twist more accurate to the time frame of the game.  (UAV=Spotting Plane, Airstrike=Artillery Strike, Attack Helicopter=Attack Dogs) There is also plenty of game mades to choose from. Then, there's my personal favorite aspect to the game. Nazi. Mother♥♥♥♥ing. Zombies. Nazi Zombies is a game mode, where you and up to three others are put together against an endless onslaught of neverending waves of zombies. As you progress the waves get harder, either by adding more total zombies, making them faster, or both. You gain points for killing zombies, and rebuilding baricades, and these points can be used to buy weapons, ammo, and to open doors granting you access to other parts of the map. There's even a mystery box, which costs 950 points for every weapon, that gives you a random weapon. One of those van even be a ray gun, straight out of 1940's era pulp fiction. And, as an added bonus on PC, you get all 3 bonus maps included with the game, which cost 9.99 each on console, and the wonder of custom maps. You can download a free, and safe map launcher, from which you can download maps made buy the community, with the same rules as before, unless changed by the creator. Overall, the game is PACKED with a ridiculously deep amount of gameplay, with appeal to almost every kind of player. All the way from those who want to experience a gritty solo campaign, those who want to play with their friends, and those just want to play the multiplayer. The game is an awesome addition to the franchise, with plenty to offer to the casual gamer, and the hardcore gamer alike.-----9.75/10",1,1

10090,"My second favorite  Call of Duty  of all time. In my unpopular opinion, it achieved the greatness  Call of Duty 4  was going for but didn't fully conquer. It's an authentic World War II shooter with plenty of weapons of the era to choose from. The story (which can be played in co-op) and characters are for the most part very good despite being significantly short, and the gameplay is frantic and exciting. The multiplayer is amazing in pretty much every sense, with an unconventional design for  Call of Duty 's standards. This was the one in the series that started zombies as well, and while  Nacht Der Untoten  isn't a highlight of the game mode it is raw and hardcore, and  Der Riese  is outstanding especially with friends. Filled with mysteries. The mode also gave birth to the marvelous soundtrack provided by  Kevin Sherwood  &amp;  Elena Siegman.   Treyarch  did a fine job with this one.  8.1/10.0 ",1,0

10090,"A review of the blood and gore effects in Call of Duty: World at War   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeFTmIZMISY   TL;DW - good body damage with great looking dismemberment, good initial blood spilling effects (though there are no blood pools or blood trails for wounded characters), decent response and death animations.  The absolute biggest issues are disappearing blood and wounds with no option to make them stay.",1,0
10090,"The best thing I love about this game is the full campaign coop! You can play coop with your friend for the story campaign from start to the end. The campaign story is quite interesting, and contains a lot of different aspect of war for you to experience: like being a captured hostage waiting to be executed, using a flamethrower to burn enemy fortress, shooting snipers out of the trees, and driving a friggin tank!  The zombie mode provides a lot of extra fun if you have friends to play with. Being an old game, there are a huge library of custom maps and mods for this game that are very stable and fun on the internet.  Beware though. Despite being a very old release, I still cannot play it in high graphic settings. I need to lower my resolution to lower-than-average to get playable framerates. This game is really poorly optimized.  It would be better if this game had Steam achievements.  My score: 8/10",1,1
10090,"Ok so here is my review about this game. Firstly i want to say that i was playing that game quite a lot on my Nintendo Wii. I was totaly shocked (Graphics Suckthe same for controllers). I was watching a lot of Custom Zombie Maps for that game and i was wandering to buy that game to play with my firends. Today i did it, i bought the game i and i am happy. I want to make kinda of a small pros/cons table  PROS: -Graphics are pretty good  -Gameplay is ok if you want to kill some Japanese asses (dont be angry on me i am not a racist) -Weapons, i can talk a lot about them  -Zombies are AWESOME  -Custom Maps   CONS: -To hard to be leveled up in mp -Over racism -Zombies are quite hard for new players -Not a lot of players now a days -Some bugs -Graphics are not amazing -Same with gameplay   In the end i want to say that if you want to buy that game make sure some one form your friend list owns that game so you will not play alone :D if what add me Kamikazi300  Thx ACTIVISION for that game :D  ",1,0
10090,"This ♥♥♥♥ing game......worth every ruble! I just recently bought this game on PC (A few months ago) but I have so much experience playing this game especially on Xbox. Now for PC I've never really tried playing the multiplayer all that much so this review is mainly based upon Nazi Zombies. Like, holy ♥♥♥♥, I've played Nazi Zombies on Xbox for years (On the later CoD's as well). And I must say this one is by far the best on PC. Why? CUSTOM NAZI ♥♥♥♥ING ZOMBIES, THAT'S WHY! You can go to certain websites that allow you to download Zombie Maps made by people, and there are maps still being created to this day! It never gets old!  You can play them on solo but playing with people is just so much more fun! Five years from now I will still be playing this game. Maybe Treyarch will revamp this game in the future ;)  Definitely worth $19.99 for the amount of custom maps you can get for yourself.",1,0

10090,"Technically the second best Call of Duty game of all time, it also happens to be my favourite.   Visuals 10/10 : I love the original level design of the game's Pacific setting, giving it almost a Vietnam War era atmoshere. The textures are composed of AAA quality and the maps can be very expansive.   Sound 10/10 : This is the best soundtrack in any CoD game. An original orchestra-inspired soundtrack is delivered subtely adding a perfect atmosphere. The melody of the Nazi Zombie lobby will always be remembered fondly. All sound effects are of the highest quality and deliver the player in an immensely audial war experience.   Gameplay 9/10 : The single player campaign is an enjoyable ride with voice acting from the likes of Hollywood actor Keither Sutherland. The level design of the campaign is incredibly detailed (from ruined sections of Europe to the fresh subtropical scenery of the Pacific War) as well as some vast multiplayer maps to conquer. The reason this CoD is my favourite though? A little thing called Nazi Zombies, one of the best video game zombie experiences to date, with a steady learning curve that is easy to pick up but very hard to master. The teamwork of Nazi Zombies is one of the strongest applications of micro teamwork in a video game. This makes it a favourite.  ",1,0
10090,"If you like the Call of Duty series this is a must buy it comes with all the map packs, the single player is good, the multiplayer omg if you like a bunch of 12 year olds screaming and hackers be my guess, Zombies on the other hand is amazing plus the Mods other people make, make you want to keep on playing So BUY THE GAME",1,0

Also, it has a very strong and enjoyable Campaign that you can play co-op. which makes it so much better. Best WWII game i know, and probably best CoD out there.

10090,"If you don't like Call of Duty: Zombies then stop reading this post right now and stop considering buying this game. You won't like it. I can't say much for multiplayer or campaign aspects of this game, but the zombies and modded zombies are truly extensive and amazing. I think the greatest thing about a lot of the custom zombies maps is that they have an end other than the death of the player(s). All in all it's a game well worth the buy, but if you don't have much money just wait for a sale (Steam has a lot of those... LOL). If you are a Call of Duty gun nerd then this is certainly a good pick because the maps have guns from every Call of Duty ever. From the good ol' not-so-classics like MW3 to the new games like AW and BO3, you name them, they're there. Also the maps have a number of themes from holiday's to movies, even original ideas. Easter eggs are a large part of the good maps nowadays, you'd be unlucky to find a good map without a zombies gun game mode too!

While the Treyarch maps are good, they eventually grow tiresome and you are left waiting for the next installment. With World @ War, you will never have that problem thanks to the modding community.  Custom Zombies are amazing, some of the maps being as good as those made by Treyarch, some even better. Even after owning this game for so long, I find myself going back it when a talented person releases a new map. Trust me, Zombie Fans, this game is worth a purchase. Lock, load and slay up into the high rounds or die trying, this game will never get old.   ",1,0

I don't really enjoy multiplayer or the story mode so I can't say much about it but I have played the first 2 missions of story mode and from what I've played it seems pretty cool.

10090,"The German army began the blitzkrieg on 10 May 1940, the German Army Group B, led by Fedor von Bock, assaulted the BEF on 14 May. As Army Group B pushed the Allied forces back towards the French frontier, the German Army Group A, led by Gerd von Rundstedt, invaded France through the Ardennes. This caught the French unawares. The French High Command was sure that the expensive line of underground forts on the Maginot Line would stop any German attack. The Germans, however, decided not to attack this line. Instead they attacked the weakest part of the French defences, the Ardennes. This was a heavily wooded area that seemed unsuitable for tanks. The French had assumed it was unsuitable for tanks because it was a hilly and wooded area. French resistance crumbled as the German tanks raced to the Channel coast, where the Germans planned to cut off the retreat of the British Expeditionary Force. The German forces simply bypassed the Maginot line which was a situation not anticipated by the defending Allies. The offensive by Army Group A cut communications between French and British commands and after approaching Sedan the German group turned northwards.   On 13 May 1940, the Germans launched a Blitzkrieg attack on Belgium and Holland. It was an outstanding success. German attacks rolled swiftly across Holland and Belgium. Dutch attempts to delay the German advance by opening the dykes and flooding the land were ineffective. The Germans used glider planes to land behind the Belgian line of defences and outflank their defenders. Holland surrendered in five days after a huge bombing of Rotterdam. Thirteen days later the Belgians surrendered. The Netherlands and Luxembourg were overrun by 19 May.   . By 20 May 1940, huge numbers of British and French soldiers found themselves cut off from the rest of their forces. The push by Army Group A towards the coast combined with the approach of Army Group B from the northeast left the BEF surrounded on three sides by 21 May. The British forces attempted to stop the offensive and launched counter-attacks including at Arras on 21 May.   Fortunately for the British, on 20 May, Hitler gave the order to the German commander, Guderian, to stop his tanks in order to allow the Luftwaffe, the German air force, to complete the destruction of the British and French forces. This was a mistake which allowed the British time to regroup. However, the BEF was unable to repel the Germans and it became clear that the Channel ports were threatened. Fresh troops were rushed from England to defend Bolougne and Calais, but after hard fighting, both ports were in German hands by 26 May. General Gort ordered that the BEF should withdraw to Dunkirk, the only port remaining, for evacuation. The British launched ‘Operation Dynamo’. Between 27 May and 4 June, as the Luftwaffe pounded the beaches, the Royal Navy and a host of vessels ranging from yachts to pleasure boats crossed the Channel to rescue the stranded troops.  ",1,1

10090,"First of all, the Call of Duty Franchise has had it's ups and downs but this game is a classic. The Campaign drops you in harsh environments which is amazing. The story telling is fantastic. Multiplayer, well it is an outdated game and is filled with hackers everywhere but still you should give it a try. And Nazi Zombies, is worthy of having its own game. The four base maps are excellent but where zombies really shines is the mod feature which allows you to play custom maps that are made by the community. This game is great with friends or by yourself either way you will have a great time.",1,0

10090,"Best Call of Duty game in my opinion, zombies are awesome, the campaign is immersive and kinda saddening at times but it makes you feel like you are actually in a war zone if you put it on the hardest difficulty.",1,0
10090,This game is great.  Story: Alot more darker then the other call of duty games. You play as a marine raider fighting Japan in the pacific that means jungles ambushes and alot more. You also play as a soldier from the Red Army while Germany is pushing them back that means urban warfare and other things. Its pretty solid.  Presentaion: It runs of Call Of Duty 4 engine so it looks great. The explosion look good and textures look good.  Gameplay: The same as call of duty 4 just with diffrent guns.  Multiplayer: Its a small community now but still fun. You get attachments and unlock stuff like cod 4.  9/10 ,1,0

10090,"A personal favorite, as well as the last World War 2 FPS of the franchise, I recommend this purchase only if you are interested in Zombies, as that is the last mode this game has to offer. Unless you prefer Multiplayer, which is still very full and plentiful of players and servers, or the campaign, with one of the better stories CoD has to offer. The zombie community started here, and as grown ever brighter since then. The custom zombie maps and mods are extremely well worth it, and a great play with friends.",1,0

I highly encourage you to buy this game and try out the custom maps, if you dont know how to do it search it up on youtube.  its not that hard. plus the original maps all dlc's are free and who doesn't love the originals. multiplayer is still fun just not nearly close to my favorite, zombies is where this game excels. if i were to rate this game, i'd rate a 8.5/10",1,0
10090,"This game is better than the newest games in the franchise. Multiplayer? Very much alive. Tons of people to play with at all hours of the day. I enjoy it better than MW3.

10090,This is by far one of the best call of duty games. The firt time we see zombies in a cod game and its amazing. The online modding and map communities are amazing as well with over thousands of different maps for zombies mod tto mix up with the origianla 4. Dont get me wrong though the original ones are the best and by far my favorite of all time. If any game should recive a 10/10 in my opinion it would be this game.,1,0
10090,Best Call of Duty ever. I had alot of fun with the campaign and the multiplayer mode. The best thing of this game is the zombies mode. if you are good in it its very rewarding. Also the custom zombie maps are one of the best features in the game.  JUST BUY IT!!!!!!,1,0

Beacause that is the game's biggest selling point, youll find the most players their. With a huge community all you have to do is look at the discussions board and their are people wanting to play with you.

Examples being Purple Dimension or Project Viking.",1,0

You'll find tons of mods for this game, and plenty of players willing to try them with you. 9/10 a classic",1,0

Custom Nazi Zombies including mechanics from cod4,blops1,blops2,blops3,mw2 and mw3 and hundreds of maps as well as completely new things.  All around a great game that i definitely recommend especially for Custom Zombies",1,0
10090,"This game, dating back to when cod was actually good and had a great story, is a World War 2 themed FPS. Even with its dated graphics, super-modded multiplayer, and overall obsoleteness, its still worth picking up for its story mode, and the zombies mode,  But wait, why not get BO2, or BO1 for zombies, you ask? Well CoD:Waw is the only cod with zombies that you can get custom maps for, this means MORE maps, MORE weapons, MORE story, and overall just a better experience.  Whether you want to kick Nazi ♥♥♥, or kick Undead Nazi ♥♥♥, this game is a must have.",1,0
10090,"Classic CoD mechanics with a solid campaign. The MP is still somewhat active (around 10 servers) and while it is not perfect it is worth playing for the WW2 themes in it, which would come like a breath of fresh air for fans of the modern warfare franchise. The zombie mode is very fun, very addicting to play with 2+ friends and it is not hard to get people to join your game in this mode.  Totally worth it at a low price if you're a fan of the Treyarch games.",1,0

10090,"My personal Favorite Call of Duty title. Grenades flying at you constantly on veteran; good times by the way. The modding community has done alot for World at War's multiplayer, like increased xp servers and low gravity servers. There are only 3 different types of killstreak rewards: Recon plane, Artillery, and Dogs. And the dogs in World at War are a 2 hit kill instead of the stupid 1 hit kill in Black ops and so on. but that's what I like about World at War's multiplayer. There's no ridiculous killstreaks like the ones we have in Modern Warfare 3 and so on. I have also encountered zero hackers in World at War's multiplayer.  Zombies: Back when the zombies mode was original and good. Modded maps are awsome. Today, Treyarch bends the zombies story to the point where it is no longer interesting and milking the hell out of their player base with outrageously priced DLC packs! Don't buy them. Not to mention that the zombies mode is now significantly more limited and difficult to the point that it's no longer fun in the Black ops titles. But World at War's zombies are simply the best.  Call of Duty: World at War gets a 9/10. That's gonna do it for this review and I will see you guys on the next one  Let's form up! ~Stealth 1548",1,0
10090,"I remember playing this game back when it first came out, on my ps3. Playing it now on the PC brings me back to the good old days. I would choose this game over Ghosts any day. The Call Of Duty Series is slowly sinking, but this game shall always remain as one of my favorites.",1,0

10090,"Infinity Wards WWII Russian campaigns have always been the weakest of the Original Call Of Duty games for me, usually with no central ally unlike the other nations campaigns which included Captain Foley or Captain Price etc. It seems Treyarch learned from Infinity Wards mistake however because the Russian campaign in WaW is fantastic. Led throughout by Resnov through some brilliant missions culminating in a remake of the original Call Of Duty's assualt on the Berlin headquarters the Russian segment oozes quality. The US section however is the weakest this time around which doesn't make it bad just not up to the standard of the Russian campaign. The visuals in this game bring war torn streets and buildings of Europe to life like non of the previous games in the series and the enhanced body damage finally makes grenades and high powered machine guns satisfying as they rip through the bodies of your enemies. I find it difficult to decide which games is better between this and CoD 2 because this is a lot more linear in it's level design and CoD 2 has massive maps with multiple objectives. However WaW is a great single player campaign and also the first in the series to introduce zombie mode for added longevity. Fantastic entry into the WWII series of CoDs and maybe even the best one.",1,0

What makes it worth your $$$ is the multiplayer system, that let you develop you skill and variety of options on field. There's also the Zombie mode that can be nice to play for a few more hours, but it is a little annoying to start all over from level 1 each time you die.

10090,"Although I reference multiplayer, this review focuses more on Campaign and Zombies.  Call of Duty: World at War is mostly good. The Russian campaign is very much close to the older Call of Duty games, and the introduction of Nazi Zombies was a signficant feature for Treyarch. However, World at War has key flaws that prevent it from being amongst the best of the franchise.  The game is a step in the right direction for the series however, with features added by United Offensive and the console-only Call of Duty 3 making a return, such as the ability to comandeer vehicles in multiplayer. Mod support is also a strength for this game in multiplayer, with custom zombies being a highlight of the game.  The campaign is okay. The Russian half is well done, featuring a mix of large open battles and tight sniping moments. The American campaign has more weak spots than the Russian campaign, such as the QTE's if a Banzai gets to close that can end up becoming a constant annoyance in the campaign, as well as the pacing, its just the worst of the World War 2 campaigns. The game on both ends tries to have you build emotional links with members of your squad, but the characters are not that memorable, outside of Reznov (which is probably due to him being a main character in the Treyarch games).  Engine-wise, the textures are clearly quite low-res, even on maximum settings. The added gore is a nice touch, wtih arms, legs and heads being blasted off. This also leads to new animation assets not present in the gameplay of other Call of Duty games. Ultimately, the games visuals are clearly held back by the fact that the game is still using the same engine used in Call of Duty 2.  Ultimately, World at War is still a good Call of Duty game.The variety of missions, including tank commanding and airplane gunning makes the campign still stand out, the soundtrack, especially on the final Russian missions stands out, and the modding community continues to still expand the game with custom-made content. This game also includes all the DLC from the console version included in free updates. Although it isn't as solid as what came before, it still plays better than anything that came afterwards.",1,0

10090,If your're buying it for zombies then thats a big Yes. Custom maps galore.  If your're buying it for multiplayer then thats a big No. Hackers galore  Only reason im giving it a thumbs up is cause of how the game was in its prime. Had about 300 hours on the PS3 version. Balanced WWII shooter..no submachin guns reaching across the maps. No running at full sprint speed carrying a giant LMG. No snipers jumping up and down acting like an ape with a rifle trying to shoot you in the head.  10/10   R.I.P. the best call of duty. You will be missed ,1,0

10090,"Call of Duty hasn't sat right with me since 4:Modern Warfare, but World at War grabbed me with it's extreme grittiness.  What makes World at War so special, is how it portrays World War II. Where as past Call of Duty games had light violence, World at War is the only Call of Duty game to feature full on gibbing, as well as bullet impaction gibbing. This and the chilling and scary atmosphere that is all throught the game, makes this the last modern Call of Duty game I've enjoyed ever.  It's Call of Duty, so you shoot opposing soldiers to get to the other end of the map. It's linear, and completely cinematic, but that never really bothered me in this game. World at War is the last WWII Call of Duty game (at least at the moment), and to me it was the last Call of Duty I could enjoy",1,0

It reminds me a lot of CoD pre-mainstream era. I actually like this campaign a lot. The usual running and gunning here and there. Annoying japanese soldiers that wont stop saying BANZAAAAIIII. Kiefer Sutherland's voice is magical. Maybe it is his voice that acts like a spell I am under. The gameplay is the same. I'd like to bring up the fact that I noticed in every CoD campaign, the player is a grenade magnet. At one point I was late reach an objective, the AI was ready to ambush me with 4 grenades at once--BOOM. Nothing underwhelming here, I am just glad I turned a blind eye after finishing the campaign and reading 'zombies'.",1,0

10090,"Call of Duty: World at War - The 5th Installment in the Call of Duty Series  The vanilla game comes with three different modes: multiplayer, campaign and zombies.  If you are buying this game for the campaign or multiplayer, I would recommend going for a different game such as Call of Duty 4. That game on PC has a much better package for those who like these two features. Regardless, the campaign on this game is phenominal and is worth playing through at least once. Likewise, the multiplayer is good but there are not always a lot of people on. The severs are dedicated, so each server is ran by someone in the world. This means that there is a plethora of custom content added to each server, making the multiplayer both fun and diverse. However, despite all of this, I would HIGHLY RECOMMEND buying this game if you are a zombies fan. You will absolutely not regret it.  After 700+ hours and countless maps, this game has brought nothing but enjoyment. It is safe to say that this game is probably the longest lasting and most exciting Call of Duty for PC. While its community is small, the amount of dedication that is put into this game and its custom content is phenominal. There is still content coming out today and each map is filled with mixed emotions, whether it is the sigh of distress from a new box map to the amazement of Black Ops 3-esque level of detail in maps.  Looking at where custom maps started until now, we were able to add new perks (from existing Call of Duty titles and from our imaginations), add buildables, add new guns and create a new format for playing zombies. Buyable endings have become a norm, swiftly replacing that of high rounds in order to increase some maps replayability. Comparatively, these easter eggs generally take a day or two to figure out by some, but are extremely satisfying if found by ones self.  For those looking for places to find good custom maps:  ugx-mods.com  (for the newest and latest custom zombie maps)  zombiemodding.com  (for the largest bank of custom maps)  zommods.com  (for the generally more popular custom maps)  Any other site not mentioned usually overlaps these sites in content.  Regardless of your experience in zombies, this game is definitely for the zombies fanatic. All skill levels are met. If you are a hardcore fan, there are plenty of great/difficult custom maps. If you are just learning, or not that good, there are a ton of box maps to begin learning the game on.  In my opinion, if you are looking to get: World at War, Black Ops 1, Black Ops 2, Black Ops 3 ----- Get World at War. It's face value is a surpreme bargain. There are at least 1000 maps so it is well worth it over the other zombie games.   This opinion may change in the future as Black Ops 1 is slowly gaining steam toward custom maps (it already has some great custom mods though, and in my opinion custom maps is pretty late for that game) and Black Ops 3 is going to be getting mod tools soon for the public. With what has been shown, Black Ops 3 will more than likely become World at War's successor in terms of custom zombies. So look towards purchasing that game once we get some more information. The possibilities will be endless for that game.  Overall, I give this game an 7/10 for the vanilla game for PC specifically, (4 zombies maps/Multiplayer/Campaign) because of how many people are online at the moment and what you will be getting for face value.  When you take all of the custom content in consideration I would give the game an easy 10/10.   Think about it, you would be paying $20 USD, or 10-15 on sale days, for a game with hundreds of custom maps, equating to 1000's of hours of play time. It is a deal you can not pass up on.  10/10 -UltzZ  ",1,0
10090,"Probably one of the best WW2 fps and best game of the COD series. I haven't seen any cheater, unlike on other COD games which are full of them (MW2 for instance) thanks to dedicated servers. There are many servers online which are quite populated, so don't think this game is dead right now, it's still awesome and worth being played.  If you like WW2 fps games, don't miss out on the chance of getting this awesome game!",1,0
10090,"If you like Zombies and you like custom maps, This is the game for you. When you buy the game, You get a couple zombies maps made by Treyarch, But there are many more that are made by players just like you. There are maps ranging from a bar to a swamp and a big box.",1,0

10090,"7.5/10 Pros:  -Nazi Zombies! -A pretty decent campaign that offers replayability value -Great multiplayer, but it's slowly dying :( -WWII shooter -Great selection of WWII shooters -Focuses on the Pacific Theatre of War for a change  Cons: -For both charaters (Miller and Dmitri) it starts off in 1942 (Makin Raid for Miller, Stalingrad for Dmitri) then all of the sudden it skips to 1944 for Miller and 1945 for Dmitri. So much happened that wasn't explored.  -Sort of branching off from the last con, there was little to no character development. Of course, it's Call of Duty and you play it to shoot down endless waves of bad guys but I think it would have been nice to show changes in characters.  -Historically awkward. For example, the only tanks you see for the Russians is the T-34-85, which makes sense because that was the most produced tank the Russians made but they had dozens of other tank models. They had at least 3 other variants of the T-34, the IS tank series and the SU TD's.  -Rock music in a WWII shooter. wtf? -Gets repititive very quickly  Buy it on sale, 20.00 is steep especially for its age.",1,0

10090,"I originally had this for PS3, but I moved on to the PC version due to the fact that hackers were invading the console versions, unforunately.  Although I can't remember the last time I played the campaign online, it's a very enjoyable one with an okay story. It's also fun when playing with friends, too.  To me, the multiplayer hasn't changed from the console versions. However, the only 2 things I find different in this version are no hackers and dedicated servers. It's still fun and memorable to play, though.  The variety of custom content this game has to offer is mainly the reason why I got this game on PC (I do sometimes play multiplayer and campaign occasionally, though).  Custom zombies is by far one of the greatest modes I've ever played, and as time passes by, more custom content keeps getting put in along with fantastic-looking maps.  From custom weapons (from other CoD games) and custom game modes to mysterious easter eggs which you can complete (similiar to the ones in BO1 and BO2), I can easily guarantee you that half (if not, most of) the time that you put into this game will mainly be because of custom zombies.  If you're a fan of zombie-slaying or if you're just looking for a good CoD game to play, don't miss out on this,",1,0

10090,"Call of Duty: World at War, also referred to as Call of Duty 5 or simply World at War, and abbreviated as CoD: WaW or WaW, is a first-person shooter game produced by Treyarch, and is the first game in the 'Black Ops' timeline. It was released on November 11, 2008 in North America and on November 14, 2008 in Europe. It was announced on December 2, 2007, and on June 6, 2008; the 64th anniversary of D-Day, Treyarch announced it would be named as 'World at War' and it would take place in the Pacific theater of war as well as the Eastern Front.  There is one campaign in the game divided into two: the American campaign and the Soviet campaign. The Soviet campaign is returning after having last been present in Call of Duty 2. There is no British campaign in the game, making World at War the only major Call of Duty set in the Second World War not to feature a British Campaign or a British playable character. It features both a solo and co-op campaign, however both are the same except that co-op is played with multiple people and certain missions are absoloutly unplayable.  The American campaign is set in the Pacific theater on the islands of Makin, Peleliu, and Okinawa. The Soviet campaign is set in the Eastern Front, mainly in Nazi Germany. In the American campaign, players take the role of Pvt. C. Miller as he fights alongside Sgt. Tom Sullivan, Cpl. Roebuck (later Sergeant), and Pvt. Polonsky. In the Soviet campaign, players take the role of Pvt. Dimitri Petrenko as he fights alongside the merciless Sgt. Viktor Reznov and the merciful Pvt. Chernov. In the American campaign, players, for the first time in a Call of Duty game, fight against the Japanese Imperial Army. Most combat takes place in jungles, where ambushes are likely. Combat also takes place in small mortar pits, ridges, beach heads, Japanese trenches, and small villages. Bunkers are a common sight in the American campaign, usually causing heavy casualties. In the Soviet Campaign, players fight against the German Wehrmacht during the push towards Berlin. Combat takes place, at first, in the ruins of Stalingrad where the player is mainly a sniper. After that, combat occurs in farmland and forests of the German town of Seelow, and finally Berlin is assaulted and close quarter fighting becomes a common feature. The last mission of the Soviet campaign sees the Red Army capture the Reichstag and the player planting the Soviet Flag on top of the building.",1,0

With revolutionary new Zombies and Mod support, makes this game more popular than any of the new games. Though this game would not be worth $20 without mods. its a semi solid game without them.",1,0

10090,"This game is amazing, i love it. I wish call of duty would have more world war 2.... But no, they still make call of duty games that take place in like 2058. The campaign was so fun to play, in one campaign level you get to drive around in a tank and blow up stuff. Who doesn't love blowing stuff up while driving around in a tank?? The best part about the campaign is that one of the characters, Viktor Reznov is played by Gary Oldman who he's a famous actor in many films such as the Dark Knight or Harry Potter.  I tried custom zombies, i see that most custom zombie maps are poorly made (don't ask me to play custom zombies with you.)  Overall I like this game, the only call of duty game that is the best, second being the modern warfare trilogy.",1,0

10090,"This was THE Call of Duty game. I don't care about the others. This one was the best.   Beware if you buy this: This game is old, therefore, modern PC hardware doesn't run it as well. I've had a lot of trouble with this game, and as a matter of fact, it's starting to crash on me again. The vertical sync is a nightmare in this game, if you turn it off, the game runs like ♥♥♥♥, if you turn it on, the game stutters like ♥♥♥♥. If you own a 120/144hz monitor you'll fair better, but you'll have to mess with the max framerate in the console to get it working properly. As I mentioned before the game does crash from time to time. If you tab out, there is a good likelyhood the game will crash upon tabbing back in, and the only way to exit the crashed game is to sign out of your PC and sign back in.  TL;DR  -DO NOT buy this game if you hate optimization issues.  -DO NOT buy this game for the multiplayer, there is none anymore, or at least nobody playing it.  -DO buy this game for the zombies. This game has, hands down, the best zombies mode in all of COD. -DO buy this game if you want some quick WWII action.",1,0
10090,"Ah Call of Duty, synonymous with 12 years olds and at least 2 years of our own pent up rage, this isn't going to be an entirely hate driven review, more to the point and not a review of the community that plays it.  W@W is the last Call of Duty that features built in mod support, and custom zombies is fantastic and its main feature imo. The campaign is mildly racist and does at times make you want to friendly fire at your AI teammates, if you have played previous games or even current games in the COD series then the campaign is what you are familiar with, nothing outstanding. Who are we kidding though, if you are considering buying this game it's not for campaign, it's either for zombies or multiplayer. Now the multiplayer has two features that COD since W@W has lacked greatly, the ability to decimate your enemy and blow bits of them off, you are rewarded for headshots and using a trench gun can blow off someone's legs. As well as the ability to drive Tanks.  The main issue I have with multiplayer is the main issue I have with the few COD games I have played, that is the fact it rewards negative actions, for instance rushing headlong in to a hoard of enemies is possible and winable, and it tries to force you to do so.  Hit detection is iffy (downright dogshit at times) and can lead to some issues like shooting people around corners due to the size of their hitbox, however one definite perk to W@W is that unlike later COD games maps are less linear in design although not to a great extent to be fair and there are custom maps for both multiplayer and zombies.  Before you decide if you should buy it or not, it is to be noted that Punkbuster anti cheat is no longer supported and there are hackers/modders in fair amounts. You must find download a patch file to override the game in order to play multipler. There is also the issue of the server list not populating for a large number of people so to see servers you have to check gametracker or another such list. As an arcade style game it is not great but not terrible, saved for the most part for its excellent zombie hoard mode. All in all its a decent time but is fairly average in presentation and execution, I would rate it 5/10 for the games multiplayer and campaign. However for zombies its a solid 8/10 due to the customization and actual mod support.",1,0

10090,"Despite having the completely unenviable job of following up CoD4, WaW manages to be pretty decent even if it does not quite match its predecessor's level of quality. Taking the series back to WW2, this game, rather than going to the classic and arguably overused setting of Western Europe (USA/Britain/Canada/etc vs Germany in 1944-45), you instead go to the Ostfront (Germany vs USSR) and the Pacific (USA vs Japan). One thing that is captured really well in this game is the dark and merciless nature of the fighting on these two fronts: you see executions of prisoners and unarmed soldiers trying to surrender (VERY common occurances on these two fronts committed by both sides), and a few times you are even asked to pull the trigger yourself. Ugly, but refreshing too since it ensures that this game isn't just another 'America ♥♥♥♥ Yeah WW2' game where its good vs evil, but a much more realistic and morally grey experience. The history nut in me liked this little detail enough that this alone would make me recommend this game, if only to get a glimpse of how vicious the war between the Americans and Japanese, and especially the Germans and Soviets, truly was.  Honestly though, it's a decent game for shooter fans too and not just crazies like me. Though this is also the game that introduced the Zombie mode to CoD, so that could be a potential turn-off for you. Still, you can have fun with this one.",1,0

When I got this for PC I was amazed at the still alive modding community, the servers of world at war are STILL ONLINE so I can host Co Op Games and invite my friends. Vs the MW2 Servers being shut down. This is a game to get, even after nearly 7 years of it being released. The gameplay is amazing.  I mean I think it supports up to 1 million troops. WOW, One million Troops! Extreeemmmeeee.  On the other note, if you keep on pressing like the XXX and the YYY and the XXX and the YYY again, you will be sucked. - Tak Fuji, E3  It does take some teamwork on nazi zombies, especially custom maps, which I love that are updated and include new perks and weapons made by the impressing modding community itself.

So once again you have to strap on your boots and helmet, pick up your rifle and show those axis powers that you are taking no prisoners. So does Call of Duty live up the its name? Lets find out shall we.  Story: 5/10 ************  The story is pretty simple. You are are fighting World War 2 through the eyes of two soldiers. The American soldier Private C. Miller whom fights in the the Pacific War Theater and the Russian soldier Dimitri Petrenko, whom fights on the easten front from Stalingrad to Berlin. There are almost no cliffhangers or plottwists. As I stated at first its mainly about fighting World War II.  Graphics: 9/10 ****************  When it comes to the graphics Call of Duty certainly does not dissapoint. It runs on the engine that was used to make Call of Duty: Modern Warfare. Everything looks really photorealistic From the weapons, to landscapes to characters. Its even so detailed, that you can see the small fabric sewings on the cloth. The game is overall darkish at almost all times. This is to portrait the dark and gloomy ambience of the game, which it does perfectly. Explosions and water effects are nice done, although I have seen better water effects, they are acceptable. The explosions however are really something to behold. Smoke also looks pretty nice. The reload animations are pretty tight. Now if there is something I have penchant for it is reload styled animations. Something every connoiseur and aficianado of FPS should love. There is nothing more aesthetic than slamming in a new clip and then reload it in a really stylish and bad ♥♥♥♥ way.  Sound: 8/10 *************  The sound department is repleted with amazing sounds. The music goes from classic to more up-beat techno. I especially relished the up-beat soundtrack that plays when you are onboard one of those heavy armed airplanes. Explosion sounds amazing. If you have a good headset or stereo with bass, crank up the volume and feel the power of the explosions. The really makes it more believing and immersive in the game. The gun sounds I am not to fond off. They sound like toy guns and are really not that engaging. The sounds of the germans and japanese soliders is also amazing. Although the germans voices is just a rehash used in Call of Duty 2. The japanese sounds can get a bit vexing, because the most one that you will hear is:'Banzai! Tenno haka banzai!' Last in this I cannot stress enough, get yourself a really good headset. Becaue the music and the sound explosions are amazing. The guns are all right, although again they sound like toy guns.   Gameplay: 10/10 ******************* Now here comes the main core of the the Call of Duty genre. The gameplay really stands out among its predecessors and other shooters for the matter. Not by introducing new gameplay mechanics but by that it is really well made. First of Call of Duty World at War runs really smooth. The gameplay is not clunky, nor is it slow. It runs really smooth. When crouching and ducking, even aiming it runs smooth. Basically its the same as all the other Call of Duty games. Aim your gun, shoot, find cover, through some nades, complet objectives. Its really simple. But so much fund, engaging and immersive. The AI is somewhat okay, although I didnt enounter some instances where they just stood still and took it in the a**** like some dimwitted boffons. The enemies are good at finding cover, flanking you, and force you out of cover by throwing grenades at your position. Some enemy tactics consists of banzaing your position which the japanese soldiers will do offen. Now one of the things what makes Call of Duty World at War are the weapons. In Call of Duty 2 and the other Call of Duty (in my opinion) had lackluster of more powerful weaponry. Take Call of Duty 2 for instance. In that game you basically use 2 guns. Rifles and submachine guns. Rifle or long range, and then submachine guns for close range. Now imagine this. You are gong to clear a bunker. You have 2 choices of weapons. First your rifles, which have way to slow fire rate in close range. Second you have submachineguns, but those guns are to weak to clear a larger group of enemies. You are really craving for the more powerful weapons. Like machineguns, grenade launchers and flamethrowers. Call of Duty 2 did have more powerful weapons, but in all honesty those weapons were *really* scarce. World at War introduces new weponry like the flamethrower and grenadelauncher for Garand and powerful machine guns. Your outload is really diversified, which bothers me to some extent, I mean sometimes you have a bolt action rifle and a pistol, the next you have a machine and a flamethrower. Weird. But as stated earlier more powerful weapons were scarce, well not in World at War. World at War is like Super Mario World for SNES on steroids. The simply throw weapons at you like crazy. Weapons are all over the place. I mean you cannot move more than 30m then you find machineguns and grenade launchers. And thats what I like about World at War. It cuts right through the bulls**** and simply arm you with the best that the game can offer, right from the beginning of game. The really prepare you for the challenges ahead. Its not like in other shooters where you have to earn the guns or buy them were they are super expensive. So that where I think it stands out, because it is not something that i have seen in recent games.  Overall: 10/10 **************** So all in all I give this game a 10 out of 10 This is simply a masterpiece of a shooter, when not considering the story. So do i recommend it? Of course with a score of 10/10 and with more than 3000+ hours in that game, I really encourage you to buy it. Every FPS fan should experience this masterpiece of a shooter.   ",1,0

10090,"Call of Duty World at War the only game I have this sudden urge to recite the Braveheart freedom speech   'Aye, fight and you may die. Run, and you'll live... at least a while. And dying in your beds, many years from now, would you be willin' to trade ALL the days, from this day to that, for one chance, just one chance, to come back here and tell our enemies that they may take our lives, but they'll never take... OUR FREEDOM!' - William Wallace",1,1

10090,"Call of Duty World at War is my favorite Call of Duty, I have played all of the Call of Dutys and in my opinion World at War is overall the best one, at least it was when this review was written. Maybe some day there will be a call of duty that I find I like more than World at War but until then, well. If you where going to play a call of duty I would strongly recommend that you at least try World at War. I dont know what it is about the game that makes me feel its the best Call of Duty, but after playing it through you may feel the same.",1,0
10090,"FEEL FREE TO ADD ME IF YOU WANT TO PLAY A GAME OF ZOMBIES OR MULTIPLAYER! I'M ALWAYS OPEN TO PLAY!  I can't even tell you how much fun this game is.  Okay, Now before you go on asking, I HAVE played the newest COD'S, They are absolute garbage, Recently after COD BO2 They started to become bad, but that's not why i'm here.  I'm here to tell YOU why you should buy this game RIGHT now.  CAMPAIGN: The campaign isn't defenintly the best in terms of story, but shooting asain's and germans are super fun, you can play if with up to 4 people, or solo, you'll have lots of fun, you'll be able to collect cards that give you nice and cool cheats, find amazing weapons (flamethrowers etc..) and blow people up!  MULTIPLAYER: Now, this is actually my favorite part about this game, the multiplayer, wow where can i start? you start off with level 1, and work your way up to prestige 10! You can unlock new guns, play amazing maps (custom maps and others..) Theyarch back then actually cared about this franchise and made these amazing maps to play on, to being a fast guy with a thompson, to playing it safe as a couch sniper, you'll have hundreds of fun on this multiplayer! TRUST ME, I'm serious...  ZOMBIES: Wow.  I can't even explain zombies, damn.  Zombies is a 4 player CO-OP Killing expirence like no other, you play as 4 different characters with their own personality, zombies has a HUGE backstory to it, it's super insane. From teleporting to different areas in Dir REISE, To going in the swamps of shi no numa, you don't even have to play the regular maps! there is thousands of custom maps, this is by far one of the best CO-OP Zombie games i've played in my life of gaming. This will put you to hundreds of hours on this game, now i only got this game last week and i already have almost a day on the game.   OVERVIEW: Like you've hopefully Read, this is probably the best COD I've ever played in my life, it tops MW2, COD 4.. All the actual GOOD Ones. Go now, buy this game, tell your friends to go buy it and have some fun, nobody's stopping you and you'll enjoy it.  Overall Rating would be 9/10  Thanks for taking the time to read this review, hopefully this has helped you!  FEEL FREE TO ADD ME IF YOU WANT TO PLAY A GAME OF ZOMBIES OR MULTIPLAYER! I'M ALWAYS OPEN TO PLAY!    EDIT: You might want to wait till the game gets on sale this summer, it'll be cheaper and better for the price!",1,0
10090,"I love this game so much. It has an awesome campaign (PLAY IT), a really good multiplayer (No hackers!), and the amazing gamemode of zombies which people are churning out maps for to this day. It's truly a great game. I never buy any game just for one feature, and niether should you.",1,0
10090,"One of the last good COD out there. the Campaign is an interesting one which will take you to the final days of WW2. World at War also comes with the standard COD Multiplayer. this is one of my favourites (apart from all the hackers). however the best part of World at war is the mod capability for zombiesmode, which keeps you more interested in the game after a long time",1,0
10090,this is an fing amazing game played it on xbox ps3 and pc andd pc in so much better and zombies on this is nerd gasumic so fun and soooooooooooo many custom maps you can download to this day 10/10,1,1
10090,"I Recommend Call of Duty: World at War Pros: 1. The Graphics are Great. 2. The Weapons and Equiment are realistic 3. The characters are Awsome. 4. The Storyline is proficient. 5. The Zombies Maps are Logical for he story. 6. The History is accurate. 7. The Bazai charges are surprising and terrffing at times. 8. Some actions you do effect the story. 9. The story isn't all way's the same, the is something always different depending on the choice you take. 10. You can play the campaign with friends online. 11. It explores battles that haven't been explored too much. 12. The Tank mission is fun. 13. The enlightening is lovely. 14. The Zombie maps are time freaky and zombie like. 15. At times its really surpising. 16. The cutscenes are amazing and dramatic. 17. Someone in your squad dies very often, so I get more and more challagging. 18. The warfootage in the cutscenes are so outstanding. 19. The environments look nearly real. 20. The characters voices are awsome. 21. The game has wartime sadness and ambition in it. 22. You can make your own custom zombie maps. 23. Its MY Favourite GAME! Cons: 1. It needs more missions in Stalingrad. 2. More missions in places like Russia, Poland, Saipan, Wake island, Midway, Philippines and more. 3. It had more vehicle missions. 4. On the tank mission the tank driver is the guy who is fighting in Stalingrad in the infantry, he is a infantryman, not a Tank guy. 5. On the plane mission I wish there was more infomation about your character. 6. I wish you could be Axis too. 7. That the bots are really dumb. 8. I wish it was longer. 9. That you can drop the two bombs on Japan. 10. I wish you can choose more country to been in then Russia and U.S.A. 11. That you can be real heroes of the War. 12. That you can do the Western Front. 13. That you can upgrade weapons on singleplayer. 14. That there were more weapons. 15. There should be a mission were you kill Hitler in his bunker. 16. All the enemy soldiers look all basely the same, in the country faces that is. 17. There are some historical errors. 18. The campgain is too short. 19. There are no achievements and badges. 20. On singleplayer the ranks for your characters don't go up.  Overall I liked this game, and I give it 8/10",1,0

The multiplayer is great, map dynamic s are awesome and so is the spawning and gun variety. 9/10 for sure.",1,0

10090,I originally got this for just the endless zombie maps and I have not been dissapointed. Then I decided to try the campaign and loved it. It is always keeping you on your toes with Japanese banzi attackers coming out of every bush and from behind every tree.
